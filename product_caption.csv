kGyZn-kOgF8,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,foreign[Music]14 pro Max[Music]I've been using the iPhone 14 pro Maxfor a week now and I've been reallytrying to think of how I can explainthis year's iPhone in one sense and Ithink I finally got it down the 14 proMax is the flagship iPhone model thatwas chosen by Apple to deliver all ofthe super late features that people havebeen begging for for years and let metell you right now Apple nailed it andnot only that but they've masterfullyrefined every bit of the iPhone intotheir Masterpiece with all of theaspects of the iPhone like the designthe display the performance the softwarethe battery life and of course thecameras finally being refined into whatApple has been imagining for years sothe question I'm gonna try to answer inthis review is whether Apple's masteringof features and this iPhone is worthupgrading to despite speculation thatnext year's iPhone 15 Pro will get USBCamong other features in my answer mightjust surprise youforeign[Music]time with fancy music and b-roll let'sget right down to business and talkabout the notch which people have wantedApple to get rid of ever since theiPhone 10 and they finally delivered orhave they Apple's Dynamic Island tookthe Internet by storm when theysurprised everyone with it at theirApple event even convincing some peopleto upgrade for that feature alone but itseems like the sentiment has shifted abit once users actually started using itsome people are complaining that you cansee the individual cutouts when it's indirect sunlight and in my honest opinionI don't think this matters or negativelyimpacts the experience at all others arecomplaining that it's not as useful oractive as Apple made it look in theirmarketing well duh it's marketing and ofcourse with regular use the dynamicIsland won't be used all the time buteven after only one week I've alreadyfound that it makes using my iPhone moreconvenient first off I love how fluidand smooth the animation are like whenface ID authenticates and for the firsttime ever I can see timers counting downat all times the dynamic Island alsofixed the number one thing that I hatedon my iPhone the low batterynotification that used to fill up yourentire display now simply pops up in theisland not only that but I've actuallynoticed myself using it for Apple musicallowing me to jump straight into themusic app by tapping the island insteadof having to go through my app switcherto find it and of course you can tap andhold to bring up the pop-up however Iwish Apple switched the controls to thisone tap brings up the pop-up and asecond tab opens the app no more tap andhold please but what a lot of people aremisunderstanding about the island isthat it's a brand new feature and it'sgonna take a few months before we reallystart seeing it become incredibly usefulas more third-party developers addsupport for things like live activitiesfor sports games in the latest IOS 16beta or even the cool little Tamagotchifeature for the Reddit app Apollo so mypoint of view is that Apple didabsolutely solid work on the Island'sHardware itself finally deleting theNotch and replacing it with somethingthat feels fresh fluid actually usefuland ready for developers to take on sojust give it some time but what reallyimpressed me was that Apple not onlyredesigned the speaker Grille to bethree times thinner but they've greatlyimproved the speakers All Around JustHear It for yourself[Music]not only are the speakers much louderthan before but the quality got betterin every aspect including the bass midsand the highs where they're now moresoft and clear and even better thedynamic range of frequencies is nowwider so you can make out differentinstruments or Tunes where you couldn'tbefore so this is a big deal for me nowmoving on I've got to cover the numberone thing that people will notice rightaway and that's the always-on displayafter so many years of this featurebeing missing Apple has finally added itbut unfortunately a lot of people arecomplaining about it being too bright sobright that they keep thinking thedisplay is on when it's not and to thatmy reply is that they're simply just notused to it give it a week or two you andit'll feel like second nature andhonestly this is the first always ondisplay I've ever seen that stillretains your wallpaper in the backgroundinstead of being completely black soit's totally unique to Apple but thedownside with that is that people arenoticing worse battery life with this onand in my personal use I haven't reallynoticed a huge drop in battery lifeprobably because I don't like using theauto brightness setting which is theonly way to experience the new 2000 nitsof brightness Outdoors but in realityApple should probably just give us theoption to dim down the always on displaybrightness to help save battery lifeinstead of being forced to completelyturn it off but as far as the always-ondisplay itself I absolutely love itsince I no longer forget aboutnotifications that popped up for acouple of seconds before the displayshuts off like what happened previouslynow they are always there so I can'tmiss them the only problem with it rightnow is that you have to tap on thedisplay once before you can tap into anotification I really just wish Applewould make it so you could tap thenotification straight from the always ondisplay and it'll authenticate with baseID open it up and go straight into thatapp so I hope Apple changes that but onthe plus side Apple has made unlockingyour iPhone more convenient than everbefore by adding swipe to wake so allyou have to do is swipe out from thebottom to instantly authenticate withface ID and unlock the phone which is amajor game changer for ease of use nowmoving on to the performance not thatmuch has changed in terms of the rawpower of the a16 bionic chip so nobodyshould be upgrading for that but thereare some major upgrade worthy changesthis year like the new Snapdragon x65modem which is not only quite a bitfaster than the previous x60 but it alsoruns cooler which leads to less heatwhich is the other major change for thelast couple of years display dimming hasbeen a very annoying issue on the proiPhones and this year Apple has finallyimproved the cooling performance byadding this new thermal tape which helpsspread some of the heat away from thechip faster than before which you canvisually see in this thermal cameracomparison and because of that displaydimming has been significantly improvedthis year now it's not completely gonelike when stress testing the graphicsbut it's much better than it was beforestaying at a consistently higherbrightness level when dimmed down soit's not instantly noticeable andannoying like before now before I showyou how this

Max Tech20. now getting back into gaming I waseven able to play Call of Duty mobile at100 brightness with no dimmingwhatsoever which was honestly shockingsince the iPhone 13 Pro Max would dimdown in less than a minute in thisscenario so this change makes the Iphoneexperience so much better and now beforeI get into some of the downsides becauseyes there are downsides we've got totalk about the cameras now on thesurface it seems like not that much haschanged with the main camera even thoughit's the biggest jump in megapixels andsensor size we've ever had in an iPhoneand that's because for some reason thenew 48 megapixel camera still defaultsto shooting 12 megapixel photos bycombining or bidding 4 pixels into oneand because of that you can't really seea big difference between the 14 pro and13 Pro's main cameras at least in thedaytime now in the night time you canclearly see that the 14 pro is betterbecause the larger sensor helps itgather more light and you can easily saythe same thing for all of the othercameras the ultra wide the telephoto theselfie camera all of them have beenimproved in terms of low light and nightmode photos which by itself couldconvince some people to upgrade and bythe way each of those other cameras haveno noticeable improvements in thedaytime as well especially the ultrawide and selfie cameras which now lookvery sharp and because of those changesthe 14 pro has now leapfrogged over theSamsung Galaxy s22 Ultra and z-fold 4 interms of camera quality like we showedyou in our unbiased camera comparisonwhereas the 13 Pro got killed by the twojust last month and part of the reasonwhy the 14 pro is now so good is ofcourse the new 48 megapixel Pro Rockcamera mode which not only shoots atfull 48 megapixel resolution but alsowith 16 bit colors and Apple's Autoprocessing which is great now while somepeople have shown absolutelymind-blowing 48 megapixel Pro raw editsonline we kept things simple bycomparing a couple of photos like thisone which clearly shows the iPhone's 48megapixel sensor beating out Samsung's50 and 108 megapixel sensors on theirmore expensive Flagship phones andcomparing it to the 13 Pro Max there wasa massive difference with the new levelof detail being easily noticeable evenon a smartphone display and some peoplegot creative online showing off someabsolutely stunning photos includingthis one on the macramers forums showingoff the Milky Way with a user beingblown away by the maximum ISO of 12768 saying that these iPhone photosfinally look like a DSLR image howeverthere are a couple of problems first ofall apple is forcing you to shoot in Proraw in order to take 48 megapixel photosand those photos take a lot of storageon average between 50 and 75 megabytesand unfortunately Apple doesn't allowyou to shoot 48 megapixel photos usingmore compressed formats like heic orjpeg you can't even convert them on youriPhone itself so it's really unfortunatethat Apple did this and making thingsworse the 14 pro still has the samelightning Port as before which meansthat it still only supports USB 2.0transfer speeds but since I prefer usingairdrop for transferring photos Idecided to test out how long it'll taketo airdrop 20 Pro Raw photos to my Macand with airdrop it took 36 seconds fromstart to finish which honestly isn'tthat bad and wouldn't ruin my day evenif it was a hundred of these Pro Rawphotos taking three minutes to transferI'd rather do that than grab a cableanyway the bigger problem is when youwant to back up your entire iPhone to aMac and it takes hours and hours on endthat's where lightning 2.0 is terribleand USBC would have solved thisinstantly so hopefully Apple gives thatto us next year or maybe evenThunderbolt but as far as the 48megapixel sensor it's really unfortunatethat we're forced to use prores and evenworse there's no 8K video recordingwhich would be totally doable on thissensor but Apple sadly chose to leave itout this year for whatever reason buteither way Apple still easily defeatsevery other smartphone brand in terms ofvideo recording like the new action modethat's not only more smooth and sharperthan Samsung's steady cam but it alsocrops in way less making it far superioras well as Apple's cinematic mode thatnow supports 4K resolution making itabsolutely destroy the other two Samsungflat ships so personally I finally thinkthat I'm going to start using cinematicmode for regular use whenever I have asubject to record so for the cameras I'mpleasantly surprised with all aspectsexcept for Apple's portrait cutouts thatstill have some issues and the dynamicrange not being as great as some of thecompetitors especially for the ultrawide camera now with all that said I'vegot to add in some of the downsidesApple forced our hand in terms ofremoving this SIM card slot just so theycould move the industry forward which iscool and all but it makes it moredifficult for us buyers to travel on topof that we still don't have Wi-Fi 6E onthe 14 pro which is kind of ridiculousin 2022 and to think that I was about tosplurge on a Wi-Fi 6E router at homebecause of the leaks and rumors and I'malso a bit disappointed that the displaybezels didn't really get that muchthinner and of course it really ticks meoff that Apple didn't add 8K videorecording When the 48 megapixel sensoreasily supports it but other than that Ithink the iPhone camera system is themost refined it's ever been as well astheir display quality which hasseemingly hit Peak refinement along withthe Best in Class always on display modethe fastest chip available in anysmartphone with minimal dimming thistime the most refined Notch that'sactually useful and speaker equalitythat is so good I'm shocked that it'scoming from a smartphone so that makesthis the most refined iPhone ever theonly question is should you actuallyupgrade to it or wait just one more yearfor the 15 Pro which will likely getUSBC and a five times zoom camera wellto be completely honest if you'reupgrading from an iPhone 11 Pro or olderyou're gonna experience a massivedifference from the display quality andthe cameras to the top tier Max savecharging system and cellular performanceand even if you're upgrading from the 12Pro I'd argue that there are still somebig improvements you'll noticeparticularly in terms of fixing thedisplay dimming issues the cameras andthe battery life and yes I know thatUSBC is going to be a nice upgrade butI've realized that I almost exclusivelycharge using macsafe and my MacBook Proat home now uses Max safe as well so Iwouldn't be able to use one USBC cableto charge both of them anyway so in mycase USBC won't really change that muchand yes I'm excited for the five timestelephoto camera which is currently inthe rumor cycle but I rarely take farrange telephoto Zoom photos anyway so Icould live without it and if you canagree with me on that and you have anolder iPhone then I'd say that this yearis finally the perfect year to upgradebecause the new Dynamic Island and thealways on display are fresh differencesyou'll experience daily as well as thefact that I'm a little bit biasedtowards the new space black color whichI've been asking for for years now butwith that said hopefully you enjoyedthis one week review of the 14 pro Maxand if you did go ahead and click thecircle above to subscribe for

gOErA-ttbdA,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,this is the new iphone 14 pro and 14 promax now from the back they look nearlyidentical to the 13 pro but when you seethe screen that's when you start tonotice that there's somethingdifferent and wonderful going on hi i'mpatrick holland and this is my review ofthe iphone 14 pro and 14 pro max i'vehad review samples of each phone on loanfrom apple for five days and i'm gonnacover the design the screen improvementsincluding dynamic island the cameras theprocessor software battery and more igot chapters enabled in the descriptionso peruse around the video at your willalso there are links to the iphone 14pro that you can check out for yourselfnow with all that out of the way let'stalk about the iphone 14 pro and 14 promax[Music]right off the bat the new iphone 14 prolooks just like the iphone 13 pro whichlooks just like the 12 pro but don't letthat sameness fool you nearly everyaspect of the new iphone has beenupgraded in large in small ways and yetthe price is the same as it's been sincethe iphone 11 pro the new 14 pro startsat 9.99 and the 14 pro max at 10.99 andin my time with them you're getting aphone that's worth every penny the newpros come in space black gold silver anddeep purple which depending on the lightand how you're holding the phone eitherlooks drab almost like a gray color orlike prince 1989 batman purplewelcome to dynamic island from theoutside there are three ways the iphone14 pro is different than previous iphonemodels it lacks a sim card tray cut outthe camera bump is achunkier and the notch has morphed intoa pill-shaped display cutout that housesan upgraded and smaller true depthcamera system the cutout on its own willmake some people happy though there areapps like youtube that need to beupdated to compensate for the cutoutslower screen positionbut it's what apple did around thecutout that's one of my favoritefeatures the screen area surrounding thetruedepth camera is used to show systemalerts like when you receive a call oryour earpods are connected it can alsoshow the progress of backgroundactivities like music playback or screenrecording controls apple calls thisfunctionality dynamic island look i knownot the best name but it's truly one ofthe best features on the 14 pro and themore time i spent with these phones themore delightful i found dynamic islandto be it works in numerous ways andsituations and it's easy intuitive and aquick way to see what's going on withoutpulling your attention away fromwhatever else you're doing on your phoneyou can interact with it for example ifi'm on a facetime call or playing musici can tap and hold to bring up controlsif i just tap on it it brings me backinto the app and you can tap anywhere onthe dynamic island directly on thecameras or off to the sides and in mydays using it i didn't notice anyproblems with smudges or fingerprintsaccumulating over the front-facingcamera or affecting face id now if youhave more than one background activityin progress like maybe you're listeningto music and have a timer on the dynamicisland splits into two parts like asideways lowercase letter ithe 14 pro and dynamic island are anexample of apple doing what they do bestthat's packaging a powerful tool into adelightful to use interfacealso the animations are excellentit will take a little time forthird-party apps to adapt to dynamicisland but some like spotify instagramand whatsapp already support itas amazing as dynamic island is it's ashame it's only available on the 14 proand 14 pro max but it's one of manyfeatures that separates the pro modelsfrom the regular iphone 14.by the way i did an entirely separatereview video for the iphone 14 which youshould definitely check out[Music]but there are more upgrades to thescreen which is now brighter outdoorsunder sunlight the 14 pro runs ios 16which gives you a ton of ways tocustomize your lock screen you can evenhave multiple lock streams set up andquickly switch between them there's alsoa new always on display which showsessential informationon your lock screen when your phone isasleep the always-on display is like adimmer version of your lock screenwallpaper but it shows the timedate your widgets and notifications butdepending on how you have your lockscreen set up it can look vastlydifferent in fact it's been soentertaining trying out different lockscreen combinations to see how theyappear as an always on displayalso seeing my iphone 14 pro have itsscreen on when it's just sitting on atable took a little getting used to ikept thinking oh i forgot to lock myphone and then to wake it up you justtap on the screen or you unlock yourphonewhen the iphone 14 pro is face down in apocket in a bag near another appledevice that you're using the always-ondisplay doesn't turn on also there is anoption in settings to turn it offcompletely when the always-on displaywas active i had a timer going and itonly showed the minutes which struck meas kind of odd i do wish there was anoption to make the always-on displaylook more discreet and for example justhave the date and time and no wallpapereven though it's using minimal powervisually there's a lot going on whichcan be distracting if you have it facedup next to you on a tabletaken in total the dynamic island thenew lock screen layout and the always ondisplay make the iphone 14 pro the mostapproachable iphone when it comes tomanaging alerts and notifications and iimagine the experience will only getbetter once live activities for the lockscreen are available in full and just aquick reminder live activities displaysreal-time updates from apps on yourphone's lock screen so you can track theprogress of a ride share you're on or ifyou're watching a sporting event get themost up-to-date scorethe iphone 14 pro has three rear camerasa main wide-angle camera a three timesoptical telephoto camera and an ultrawide the main camera has gotten the mostsignificant hardware changes for exampleits focal length is wider going from a26 millimeter equivalent on previousiphones to a 24 millimeter one it's nota drastic difference but it definitelyallows you to get a little more intoyour framethe main camera gets a larger 48megapixel sensor now while moremegapixels doesn't necessarily meanyou're going to get better photos it'show apple uses those extra pixels whenyou take a photo groups of four pixelsare combined into one big pixel theresult is a 12 megapixel photo that'sbrighter has less image noise and betterdetail and in use the main camera takesexcellent photos image quality anddetails are great especially for a phonebut really where i see improvement is inmedium and low light situations colorslook good textures are great i meancheck out this photo i took in sanfrancisco on a very foggy morningnotice the textures in the bricks on thebuildings and the gradual way thefortune pro captured the fog engulfingthe salesforce tower buildingtake a look at this photo of a palm treenow this was part of a group of palmtrees and under the canopy it was verydark the 14 pro did a solid job ofcapturing the different textures and theleaves and the bark but also helpedboost the brightnessand if you're so inclined you cancapture 48 megapixel full resolutionphotos using pro rawi should warn you that the files arebig but with good lighting like thisphoto i took of the bay bridge at sunsetyou can capture a lot of detail i meanlook closely at the cars on top of thebridge and those support cables theultra wide camera also gets a boost itgets a new sensor with more focus pixelsand a stepped down f 2.2 aperture lensall this adds up to much sharperultrawide photos the sensor combinedwith apple's revamped photo processingthat's called photonic engine means youget better photos even in less idealsituations photos and videos are still astep down compared to those from themain camera but these improvements arevery welcomed and macro photos also geta boost macro mode is still triggeredwhen you try to take a photo with themain camera and you're close to asubject the iphone 14 pro switches tothe ultra wide camera and crops in tomimic the same framing as the maincamera but allows you to get the closerfocus from the ultra wide camera theresults are better macro photo imagequality especially in medium and lowlightthen there's the telephoto camera whichis basically identical to the one onlast year's 13 pro but does get a littleboost from that photonic engineprocessinglike the ultra wide camera images fromthe telephoto camera in terms of imagequality especially in dimmerenvironments is still a step behind themain camera but take a look at all thesephotos and videos that i shot with theiphone 14 pro and 14 pro max with itsrear cameras[Music][Music]so in terms of videos there are severalimprovements the new lenses and sensorgive video image quality a boost thoughinlow lighting the 14 pro still suffersfrom light source reflections it'sbetter than previous iphone models butit's still therecinematic mode can now record 4k videoat 24 frames per second there's alsothis new super video image stabilizationtool called action mode when you go toshoot a video you can toggle it on andthe phone crops in a bit to help keepthe image centered and the horizon levelif you're shooting in 4k action modedrops the resolution to 2.8k but theresults are impressive also you canshoot in pro res if you really wanted toalso in trying to do some comparisontest with action mode it's just worthacknowledging how good the imagestabilization is for regular video modebut take a look at this action modevideo of me riding a bike over speedbumps i mean what speed bumps am i rightwhile other phones have similarstabilization modes it's wonderful tosee this come to the iphone and it worksacross all three rear cameras and thenthere's the true depth camera that getsan upgrade the lens is brighter with anf 1.9 aperture and for the first timeever there is auto focus on the iphoneselfie camera whichworks great for group selfiesdriving all of these performanceupgrades is the new a16 bionic chip the14 pro and 14 pro max are not onlyfaster than any iphone we've ever testedbut these are the fastest phones we'veever used in everyday use everythingfeels peppy on the 14 pro gaming is anabsolute delight and the subtle thingslike animations into and out of dynamicisland are super smooth in terms of thebattery the regular 14 pro had noproblem making it through a day itypically got six hours of screen ontime and with the 14 pro max i was ableto consistently get a day and a half ona single chart and charging is okay icharged the 14 pro max for 30 minutesand the battery went from 14up to 59and that's using the included lightningto usb c cable but a 20 watt wallcharger that i had to buy separatelysince it doesn't come with onenow if you have last year's iphone 13pro i don't think you should upgradewhile the improvements and new hardwareand features are a lot of sizzle youaren't getting a drastically differentexperience upgrade your 13 pro to ios 16and enjoy but if you have a 12 pro andhave in it to upgrade the 14 pro is apretty sizable step up in terms ofperformancebattery life camera quality and featureslike dynamic island and if you'rerocking an iphone 11 pro or older theiphone 14 pro is a giant upgrade allaround[Music]the iphone 14 pro is my favorite iphoneand most of that is because of therevamped lock screen always on displayand that new dynamic island i still havemore testing to do with these phones somake sure you're subscribed to allthings cnet for more stories and videosabout the 14 pro and 14 pro max but nowi want to hear from you what questionsdo you have about the 14 pro and 14 promax let me know in the comments lastlyif you've enjoyed this video please giveit a like and thank you for watching[Music]
iNYEzYKrcqI,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,all right i think we're good hey guysi'm tom the tech chap and this isactually being shot on the new iphone 14pro max in cinematic mode in the new 4kresolution because if you remember onthe 13 if we go back which i'm nowshooting on you can see it's a littlebit fuzzier because it's limited to1080p and also you only get the 30 fpsoption which is not particularlycinematic so let's go back to the 14 andback to the 14 pro max so you can seeit's a little bit sharper we have awider field of view it does look nicerand of course also we have both 30 and24 fps options so the improved cinematicmode is just one of the upgrades but assomeone who has been using this the 13pro max as their main it's a dailydriver for the best part of the lastyear except when i've been testing otherphones naturally i'm curious how muchbetter this 14 pro max is so while iwill be doing a sort of fuller morein-depth long time review in a few weeksi do have a few thoughts i want to shareabout the 14 pro max so far and if youdo enjoy the video then cheeky like andsubscribe would be lovely and i can tellyou straight away that if you are buyingone of these it's gonna sting a littlebit more than usual as here in the ukthe pro max is a hundred pounds moreexpensive than last year now starting at11.99 and going all the way up to 1749if you really want to show off with anew one terabyte model and to makethings worse the us haven't had a priceincrease and that 1750 pound iphone 14pro max one terabyte which i actuallyhave here is only 1600 in the usalthough that is before sales tax sooutside the u.s we've had a bit of aprice hike and it may make youreconsider whether you want or can evenafford one of these especially with thecost of living right nownow by this point you've probablyalready watched a dozen videos on youriphone so you know what's up but tosummarize quickly we get this very niftynew dynamic island pill shaped notch thebezels are a tiny bit thinner there'salso two new colors we have midnightblack and deep purple although i havethe silver one here we get the new a16chip which is a little bit faster andalso unlocks a couple of new featuresthe screen gets quite a bit brighter forhdr video and if you're outdoors there'sbigger and faster camera sensorsincluding a new 48 megapixel main lenswith a new two times optical zoom optionalso apple's deep fusion cameraprocessing tech magic wizardry thing isnow called the photonic engine videogets the improved 4k cinematic mode aswell as a new super stable action modethe selfie camera has a wider apertureand now supports autofocus apple saysthe battery should last about an hourlonger than last year and there's also acouple of new safety features crashdetection and satellite sos although thelatter of which is only available in theus and canada for now and of course itships running ios 16 with the new iphone14 pro series exclusively getting thisnew always on display which takesadvantage of the new one hertz refreshrate so it shouldn't drain your batterytoo muchnow side by side with last year's 13 promax the 14 slimmer bezels and smallernotch i think do add up to make thescreen feel a bit more spacious and lesscramped if you will it's not a night andday difference but more obvious than ihad expected but what really jumps outis this new dynamic island and whilepeople love to call anything new agimmick and certainly it's not a reasonto upgrade to the 14 pros by itself ithink it's neat although despite the newpill shape cut out being 30 smaller thanthe previous notch in reality it doesn'tmake much difference as that extra sliceof screen that you get above it isn'tparticularly useful and actually thisnew cutout does sit slightly furtherdown on the screenbut aesthetically i think it looks a lotmore modern and also is one of the fewways that you can actually differentiatethat you have the new one versus the oldone which is important to some peopleand it does add some quite uniquefunctionality it's kind of like analways on top notification bar widgetthing with some very nice animationsdownsides well firstly it seems all thata single tap opens the app but then along press expands the widget i feellike it should be the other way aroundand also there's a bit of a reachabilityissue on the promax's bigger screen anyinteraction including accepting a callis now a two-handed jobone of my concerns though is that mymucky fingerprints as i'm interactingwith dynamic island are going to smudgethe front camera lens and when i wastaking a picture last night at the bar idid notice there's some flaring going onand then sort of cleaned it with myt-shirt and it went away so i amexperiencing a little bit of that andkind of just instinctively now i'mregularly cleaning the lens with myshirtelsewhere it's all very much the same aslast year we're still rocking thatlightning port no improvement tocharging speeds either the only othernoticeable change is this new always ondisplay or aod which quite nicelytransitions into the lock screen so itdoes feel more intuitive and streamlinedcompared to every other phone that justgoes black and then pops up with a clockor an image although at the momentthere's not a lot of customization butfuture ios updates are due to add moreso i went out to dinner last night andwhile i know it's never good form to putyour phone on the table you know peopledo sometimes if you're in the office andit's on your desk but one thing i havestarted to notice is that the always ondisplay is too bright too obvious it'staking me a minute to realize the screenis off well in aod mode so i keep thenpressing the power button to fully turnit off but then it turns it on now youcan disable the aod if you prefer whichi might actually do because right now ifind myself just flipping the phone overnow at the opposite end of that dimmedlock screen we have this new higherbrightness in fact this is the brightestphone you can buy hdr video is bumped upto 1600 nits and outdoor brightness isnow a whopping 2000 although undoubtedlykeeping the screen this bright willdrain your battery fasternow the very first thing you should dowhen you get your new iphone is put acase on it why because well this this iswhy i learned the hard way so i'veteamed up with casetify who also sentover this lovely box of goodies fromtempered glass screen protectors to lenscovers and of course a few cases now ihave the iphone 14 pro max so i'm goingto use this which is one of case if i'snew ultra impact cases there's also newimpact and bounce cases as well and witha new twister design that includes theireco shock technology we get 20 moreprotection in fact the ultra impact casei have here gives me up to 11 and a halffeet of drop protection we have the 5xmil standard it's magsafe compatible ofcourse and actually it's made with 65recycled and plant-based material can'tbelieve in doing this these just arrivedthis morninghere we goit's a little bit scuffed on the bumpersbut that's kind of the whole point itdid its job and not a crack on the caseor importantly the screen that'll dodefinitely check out caseify's newiphone 14 collection and i'll leave alink in the description below okay let'stalk about this camera so we have theusual three lenses uh with the main lenswhich we've got now we can pull out tothe ultra wide which is also improved infact the new photonic engine should giveus improved low light on all the lensesversus last year but as you can see ifwe go up to two timesthat's new so it's cropping in or atleast using the central 12 megapixels ofthe new 48 megapixel main lens you canalso punch into the usual three times ifyou want and then you can pinch in allthe way up to 15 times which i havenoticed is a little bit sharper actuallythan last year but still not idealcomparedto the competition bring it back toomuch too much too much i think we'd haveall liked a bit of a longer zoom as wellnow switching to portrait mode and ifyou want jump to two times again uh whatwe now have is foreground blur which tobe honest i thought we already had butessentially if i put my hand out hereit's still focusing on my face but youhave this niceforeground blurof course this ultra wide camera if wepunch back out also doubles as a macroso i can then use my little guy againand come rightup to the camerais one of the best if not the best macrocameras you can get with a 15 centimeterfocal length so that's pretty handy aswellbut mostly it's about new sensors thewider apertures and also the newphotonic engine which is doing its magicbehind the scenes so let's look at somephotos side by side and see if it ismuch of an upgrade over last year andbefore i tell you which is which can yousee much of a difference and also do youprefer one over the other well somewhatpredictably i put the new 14 pro max'sphoto on the right did you guesscorrectly let me know in the comments sothere are definitely a few trends thati'm seeing if you look at sarah's facehere you can see on the right with theiphone 14 pro max it's more detailedit's sharper the colors aren't as warmand all together it's just morerealistic across the board i'm noticingan improvement in white balance you cansee here the castle is a more naturalgray whereas on the 13 it's got a blueytint to it now in good light goingbetween the three main lenses thereisn't an awful lot in it although zoomedin with a three times telephoto the 14is a lot sharper dare i say oversharpened which is a trend i'm seeing aswelli mean look at this at first glance nota whole lot in it but then if you lookat the word and the fine detail on theflowers the 14 does come across as moredetail but it looks like they've justturned the sharpness up to 11.i love this photo and there isn't reallythat much between them although you cansee that blurry bokeh effect is moreprominent both in the foreground and thebackground of his ears and the top ofhis hair which i think looks morenaturalso my takeaway with the main cameras isthat we are seeing a noticeableimprovement particularly in low lightparticularly in terms of white balancecolor accuracy and detail i do thinkshots are over sharpened i hope applecould maybe turn that down a little bitand i'm definitely getting samsung vibesfrom the aesthetic now as opposed to theflatter warmer less realistic look thatwe've had with iphones for quite a fewyears nowswitching to the selfie i actually kindof prefer the warmer look of the 13 promax here but also you can see the 14 isonce again more detailed and sharperpossibly too sharp honestly if i changedthe 14 pro max text to galaxy s22 ultrai think you'd probably believe me it isquite a different look that they'regoing for now with a 14 seriesokay let's talk about video and whilethere were rumors that we might get 8kthat never really materialized in factwe haven't had any change in resolutionoptions here except for that new 4kcinematic mode now in good light thereisn't really much between them althoughswitching between lenses i'm not sure ifyou can see that as well it does looknoticeably smoother on the 14 series itwas already very good on the 13 butactually i do find the transition whilefilming is now smoother but sadly youstill can't pause and resume video andalso you can't switch between the frontand rear cameras or vice versa whilefilming you can see here again like thephotos the 13's struggling with thatwhite balance and the color of thecastle the blue of the sky isoverwhelming everything else the colorson the 14 are much more natural and trueto lifeokay let's do a little side-by-sidevideo both shooting at 4k 30.uh this is my studio nice and clean andtidy as you can tellbut hopefully if i just sort of walkaround a little bit you'll get an ideaif the video quality is any differentthe stabilizationthe color which i'm noticing seems to bequite a big difference this year withthe 14 seriesso let's have a little close-up on mycamera i shoot usually with the a7 s3this is my uhbig tv my 75 inch lgi've got this very cool table you mayhave spotted this in a few videos it'scalled a fuse city first tablebasically it's rgb on the outside and itdraws patterns with a little metal ballthat goes around inside this is my usualdesk setup again nice and tidyi actually have been shooting mostlyover here today in fact this is the editfor the very video you're watching whichhas some work to be done but so far whatdo you thinkof the videoare you seeing much difference side byside on the screen doesn't seem to beall that differentwhat do youthink honestly i'm struggling a littlebit to see the difference i would saythere's maybe a touch less noise on the14 it's a tiny bit more detail perhapsbut it's all very minor and kind of hardto see even side by side i'm sure you'llagree and actually if i jump to thethree times lens on both while the 13 isnoisier it's more detailed it seems tobe worse on the 14 although we do getless noise which is a bit odd andfinally we have action mode which youenable by tapping the little runningicon man at the top of the camera appand that basically drops the resolutiondown to 2.8 k and gives you much morestable video which is ideal if you'redoing some pov shots or you're runningafter your kids it's nothing really newfor android phones but for iphones wellit gives you another option[Music]now what about the a16 chip in herewhich only the pro and the pro max getis it really that much faster well applesays the a16 is 10 faster and 20 moreefficient than the a15 and that doesroughly tally with my results ingeekbench and 3dmark we're gettingslightly higher scores and alsospecifically here in 3dmark you can seethe 14 used less battery during the sametest so a slight improvement but thenthese tests don't really give you thefull picture we've got a new neuralengine for ai and camera processing anew display engine which unlocks thescreen's higher brightness and also thenew 1 to 120 hertz pro motion whichmeans that lock screen can be reallyefficient in real terms this is the mostpowerful phone you can buy and alsogenerally games are better optimized onthe apple app store versus the googleplay store for a more fragmented androidecosystembut what about battery life wellinterestingly the new 14 pro maxactually has an ever so slightly smallerbattery compared to last year's 13 promax but really it's going to come downto the a16s better efficiency how muchthat always on display drains yourbattery also if you're running aroundoutside with that max 2000 at brightnessa whole bunch how you use it will havethe biggest impact so far it seems to bejust shy of what i was getting on my 13pro max we may see some improvement overtime as the ai recognizes your patternsof usage and we get more softwareupdates but still the 14 pro max is oneof the best phones you can get forbattery life although i must say i hadhoped we'd see a boost in charging timesas it still takes a good half hour toreach 50 percent samsung and applereally need to catch upon paper there are a lot of upgradesthere's a lot to talk about but inrealityit all feels very familiar especially ifyou've used an iphone for the last twoor three years let me know what you makeof the 14 pro max and also thiscinematic mode which i've been filmingall this talking head a role inthroughout the video thank you so muchfor watching and i'll see you next timeright here on the tech chat
ntm96mwJxyc,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,foreign[Music]the iPhone 14 pro Max is Apple's latestattempt at exemplifying what it means tobe a flagship smartphone it's powerfulit's pricey and it's purple but how welldid Apple do at succeedingly 13 Pro Maxthat came before and does it really liveup to all the hype well that's whatwe're here to find out today but first aword from our sponsor bellroy is

headdown to the link in the videodescription you can pick up one of thesecases and get an exclusive 10 offanything on their site thanks again tobellroy for sponsoring today's videooutside of the dynamic Island whichwe'll get into in a bit there reallyisn't much new stuff going onaesthetically with this phone and atfirst you might feel like there shouldhave been more changed but what shouldthey change honestly sure they could getrid of the massive camera bump but Ithink Apple has their reasons forletting it stick around and it's one ofthe iPhone's most distinct physicalfeatures but other than that I thinkthis design is as functional as it needsto be when it comes to the new purplecolor I think it's a bit of a letdown interms of how it appears under certainshades of light it's just a a little toodull and understated in my opinion and Ithink they're Pacific Blue and midnightgreen colors are the best pro phonecolors Apple has done thus far but youobviously don't have to choose purplethere's still the standard set of Applealternative colors I think the newdisplay on the 14 pro Max might be myfavorite aspect of this phone from ausability standpoint and not evenexclusively due to the dynamic Islandthe 14 pro Max is now 40 percentbrighter at the top end and that's madea huge difference for me whenever I'mout and about and have the sun blaringover my display I haven't had a singlemoment of wishing this display could getbrighter which is not something I couldsay for the 13 Pro Max and thisincreased brightness benefits HDRcontent as well which I pretty muchshoot everything in at this point you'llnow be able to natively view HDR contentthat pushes brightness up to 1600 nitsand that's not a necessity at all but itsure is nice to have the display alsohas a slightly higher resolution butthat also isn't something you wouldnotice from a day-to-day perspective andwith all these improvements I think the14 pro Max has the best display you canget getting a smartphone at this pricepoint period now the dynamic island isthe number one marketing push for thepro iPhones this year they finallyremoved the notch after five very longyears and functionally this is animprovement over the notch when youconnect earphones play music silenceyour phone use a navigation app or watchvideos the dynamic Island will play intoall of that and it's an extremely fluidsetup that doesn't take that long to getused to it's a very competent way ofmaking the camera Notch something that'sactually usable but I do have a slightgripe the thing is with the notch aftera while you would just not notice itbeing there but with the dynamic Islandit never disappears because if you'renot interacting with it it's just alwaysvery present when doing things likewatching full screen videos or scrollingthrough a document with a light coloredbackground it's just an extremelynoticeable thing and while I stillappreciate the fact that the dynamicIsland can do things I somewhat miss thefact that the Notch was something thatyou could just not think about after awhile a thoughtless aspect of the designthat's not the case with the 14 pro Maxand after are using this for weeks Ivery much feel like this feature shouldhave been implemented in the non-14 ProModels as well this feature is cool andlooks like futuristic but there'snothing Pro about it and yes we knowthat apple is a very open-ended mindsetwhen it comes to the word Pro but Ithink Apple might have been hurtingthemselves more than they would havehelped themselves by reserving thisfeature for the pro iPhones because thatwould have been one feature that wouldautomatically make people think of thenumber 14 instead of just 14 pro buthopefully this comes to the entire 15lineup next year the display also nowhas an always on mode and you can turnthis feature off in the settings ifyou'd like but this way unless yourphone is in your pocket or face downyou'll always see any act notificationsyour wallpaper and widgets in a slightlydim State there isn't really anycustomization for this feature so itonly works in the way Apple has it setup here but if this is something you'vebeen wanting on your iPhone you canfinally use it with the 14 Pros buthonestly given how pretty functionalistthis feature is I'd recommend justturning it off honestly it'll definitelyhelp with the battery life if you don'thave this feature on now a somewhat bigissue that Apple kinda just threw at usWas the removal of the physical SIM trayfor the us-made iPhones which means thatyou have to set up an electronic Sim inorder to get service on an iPhone madefor the US and it's safe to say thatcarriers apple and everyone else werenot prepared to make this transitionbecause there were a lot of technicalissues going on in the back end peoplewaiting for days to get proper servicemyself included it was a big mess butnow that the frenzy is frozen over so tospeak I know that's an issue that Ishouldn't have to deal with goingforward and it's cool to know thateventually we'll be at a place where wedon't have to worry about dealing withphysical SIM cards but for travelinginternationally this does raise somequestions that I'd honestly like to knowthe answer to I'm actually going out ofthe country in a month and I actuallyhave no idea how I'm going to handlegetting service out there but uh I guessthat's another problem for another daythe performance of the iPhone 14 pro isone of the more underwhelming aspects ofthe phone and that's mainly because the13 Pro Max was already so good in thatArena remember that the chip power thisphone is essentially in the samearchitecture family that's poweringApple Computers so lag is nowhere to befound pretty much anything you throw atthis phone it can handle the a16 bionicchip powering the iPhone 14 Pros isn'treally a substantial on paper upgradefrom last year's a15 it's got the sameamount of cores all around but the a16is different in the fact that it'srunning on a smaller four nanometerprocess which means it should be moreefficient doing the same kinds of tasksas far as how that efficiency isactually played out for me in real worldusage well I honestly can't tell howmuch better it is especially with thebattery life I've been getting which I'mgoing to get into later but overall thisisn't a sluggish phone by any means itjust really isn't that much faster thanthe 13 Pro Max in a way that I canactually notice so the battery life ofthe 14 pro Max has certainly been theweakest point of the experience for meso far to be clear I'm averaging abouteight hours of screen on time which ispretty freaking good obviously but atleast coming from the 13 Pro Max I'venoticed that I'm ending the day withabout 10 to 15 spent less battery lifethan I did on the 13 Pro Max I wouldusually end the day with about 55 to 57battery life and with this 14 pro Max Iusually end the day with about 40 to 43percent I mean that's still fine butit's just disappointing to know that the14 pro Max has had worse batteryperformance than the last phone but thissomewhat makes sense because the batteryin the 14 pro Max is physically smallerthis time around it's only about by 30milliamp hours which is next to nothingbut maybe that is actually made anoticeable difference or maybe it's justiOS 16 perhaps there's a software updatewaiting in the wings that could improvethe battery performance only time willtell but I will say that if you canafford this 1100 phone I think it'sreasonable to say that you couldprobably afford a portable chargingsolution to go along with this phone ifyou find that the battery life is not upto your standards two safety orientedfeatures that Apple made sure to makenote of in the keynote is firstly afeature that enables satelliteconnectivity in the event of anemergency this will enable you to putyour iPhone up at the sky and contactemergency services if you have no cellservice and I'm fortunately not going tobe able to test that for you but the newcrash detection feature uses sensors andmics within the iPhone to determinewhether you've been in a crash and allowyou to easily contact emergencyresponders and there is someone whoactually tested crash detection Lukemiani and Sam Cole from iupdate made aninsane video where they tested out crashdetection on the iPhone and the newApple watch to see how well it actuallyworks and there will be a link to thatvideo in the description down below thesecond biggest marketing push for thenew 14 pro is the new 48 megapixel mainsensor in the rear camera which is ahuge jump over the 12 megapixel sensorwe're used to and I've had for yearsthis new sensor is using quad pixeltechnology which means that you've nowgot a 2X Zoom option which is enabled byall the enhanced detail you're gettingwith this 48 megapixel sensor in termsof the photo experience I gotta say thisis a pretty noticeable jump over the 13Pro Max in terms of natural detail anddepth of feel when putting it side byside with 13 Pro Max you can definitelysee the differences but I'm aprofessional videographer and Techreviewer so I pay attention to thesedetails it's my job and so when puttingit on its own I'm not sure how much theaverage user would be able to tell howmuch better this camera is the dynamicrange in low light performance of the 13Pro Max was already great and the 14 proMax is even better but again not by ahuge margin and if I were to quantify itI'd say maybe about 15 or 20 percentbetter but overall when it comes to therear cameras for photo taking thebiggest games are going to mostly be inthe improved natural detail and depthwhich are all welcome changes in myopinion in terms of the video the onlyfeatures to take note of this year are anew action mode which improvesstabilization through software whenfilming handheld and then there's now a4K mode for the Cinematic video featurethat was introduced last year actionmode is pretty cool in terms of itsability to stabilize footage with a lotof movement the only downside is thatyou're not getting the full 4Kresolution it's a downsized 2.8 K framebut this is no surprise to anyone whotried to stabilize footage within avideo editor before everything alwaysgets cropped out a little bit in thatprocess cinematic video getting 4K iscool too you can tell a differenceversus 1080p but it's not a wow featureit's almost like buying something andthen getting an upgrade that makes itthe way you thought it always shouldhave been from jump but overall videoperformance isn't too different thisyear and that's fine because last year'scamera was already excellent for videoand in my opinion this is the best videotaking smartphone in existence thefront-facing camera has definitelyimproved for my testing versus the 13Pro Max I'm seeing more detailssubstantially better color accuracy anda lower aperture sensor so the low lightshould be a tad bit better and I thinkthe biggest feature of them all is fullyfledged autofocus for the front camerafor the first time ever when you thinkabout how many people use the selfiecamera for live streaming postingstories recording themselves and so on Ithink there's an argument to be madethat the front camera should be nearlyas capable as the rear cameras and I'mglad Apple's made these improvementsthis time around clear that the 14 proMax isn't perfect but even with itsflaws and drawbacks versus the 13 ProMax like the battery performance I thinkI can still confidently say that this isthe most capable iPhone Apple's everproduced and there's a whole lot to loveabout this phone if you're coming from a10s Max an 11 Pro Max even the 12 ProMax the display is killer the dynamicisland is a really nice usability touchthe cameras are still Best in Classespecially for video and the overallperformance leaves very little tocomplain about if you want the biggestbaddest iPhone I think this isdefinitely worth it this year if that'swhat you're looking for as far as nextyear though I think firstly lightningPort has got to go we need USBC on thepro iPhones at least and now that we'vegot a 48 megapixel sensor we should beable to do 8K video recording and Ihonestly thought we were going to begetting that this year and then lastlyfaster charging both for wirelesscharging and wired charging because thatis one area where the iPhone is stillway behind everyone else at this pointbut after that I honestly can't think oftoo much more to throw in this thingthing what do you guys think though didApple do well with this year's ProiPhone let us know in the commentsection down below and if you enjoyedthis video be sure to give it a thumbsup and subscribe for future content likethis thanks for watching and I'll talkto you guys in the next one
GzFhsM6k5dg,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,you tooit's one month later with the iPhone 14pro Max and I was wrong about this phoneand so were you I'm gonna tell youexactly why in this review but before wego there this video is being brought toyou in partnership with epidemic soundif you're a content creator like me andyou upload on any social media platformthen you want to check out epidemicsounds expansive and massive musiclibrary on their website and you can doit all for free for 30 days via the linkdown in the description below check itout and if you like it and love it keepit which you probably will let's getinto this iPhone 14 pro Max right herenow this video is going to be split upinto two perspectives and point of viewsnumber one just straight up userexperience number two my perspective assomeone who just used the iPhone 13 ProMax for a full year and upgrading to the14 pro Max and how I feel their you knowupgrade worthiness wise let's start offright here the design the build thequality that Apple quality this is oneof those things where I don't know ifApple has missed in a while with theiruh phone quality build it's just allaround just a very well built device andit's using premium materials stainlesssteel sides this is something that notmany or any other Flagship devices tendto use most other flagships even I'mfinding out and realizing like Samsungand so forth are using aluminum which isgood in the terms of weight but as faras like that premium build quality andwhat you're spending your money for whenyou're paying for Flagship devicequality I think stainless steel is whereit's at now it comes at a price ofweight but the weight and the feel ofthis 14 pro Max to a lot of peopleequals quality build from a userexperience perspective it just feelsvery great very premium and very wellmade so I do give props to Apple forbuilding high quality devices like youfeel premium holding this device youfeel like you have a premium device andyou've gotten your money's worthspeaking on price point from the 12 Proto the 13 Pro to the 14 pro and proMaxes the price point has stayed evenkilled they haven't raised their pricesApple has been extremely fair in myopinion with their pricing on thesemodels as of the last couple what two tothree years the price hasn't went up soshout out to Apple for keeping theirpricing the same yet they're making youknow small improvements and upgrades totheir devices and that could be due toApple strategy and how they build theirdevices and what a lot of people like tosee as a non-changing a non-innovativeyear-over-year upgrade when it comes tothe Apple iPhones I'm starting torealize that with the iPhone experienceit's not as much Hardware as it issoftware like iOS 16 is a a bigcontributor to the newness and the feelthat you're going to fill with this 14pro Max there are some physical featureswithin the 14 pro Max that add on to theiOS 16 experience but nevertheless iOS16 is the iPhone experience you just getwhich type of hardware and casing andbuild quality you want and whateverprice point and budget you can afford asfar as the iPhone that you choose for mepersonally the iPhone 14 pro Max is mychoice of iPhone for everyday userexperience so build quality wise thisthing is A1 beautifully builtbeautifully donewell made the only thing I would say tobuild quality that I would like to seeis more color selection as of right nowbecause I know like when it comes tolike the whole Notch and you know doingunder display cameras and things likethat whenever it's done just make sureit's done well that's my thing but I'lldeal with the uh pill-shaped DynamicIslandas it is yeah so essentially when itcomes to build quality from theperspective of someone who's justupgraded from the iPhone 13 Pro Max it'sthat same quality of build quality soit's not either way you know I mean it'snot really an upgrade neither adowngrade so it's justgoodall right so let's get into this displayright here which I want to show offactually you know what let's show it offeven betterwe're going to talk about what I do whatI just did right there in the sectionsoon but when it comes to displayshout out to Apple for yet again havingthe highest rated display on anysmartphone display mate gave them arating of a plus the top of the top andthe same was done last year on theiPhone 13 Pro Max but this year thisdisplay has some differences it has theability to drop all the way down to aone Hertz refresh rate to just eliminatea lot of the battery drain that could bepossible when it comes to this always ondisplay since I mentioned it let's getinto it the always on display as youguys are seeing me rock right here if Itap on this display brings it to life ifI hit this power button it dims it downand this is typically what you're goingto see in the beginning I did not likethe always on display I like the UI Ilike what I was getting but I didn'tlike how bright it was and the bigportion of that was the photo that Ichose to use I chose to use a brightphoto for my background at that timematter of fact I'll show you exactlywhich photo it was how do you get thisthing to change oh yeah hold down therethis was the one that I was using so ifyou use a brighter photo when you go todim itit's not going to be actually you knowwhat look look at Apple I think Applechanged a little something but at nightthis is not going to be as dark as if Iwere to go with a darker background so Ihave like a pitch black background thatI can do and then I have like this oneand the cool thing about this with thisalways on display in terms of design anddevelopment and what we have look atthis right here I can just change myoils on display with a tapand then I could go there I have threebackgrounds on there I could have didmore but I have three that I couldswitch in between all with the tapthat's extremely fireif you don't know how to do that I'llshow you really quick it's really easywhen you set it upyou're always on display if you go toadd a new one you want to do the photoShuffle and then while setting up thephoto Shuffle there's those three dotsin the bottom right corner you knowthat's typical with a device when youwant to do a setting and you're going totap on that and then you hit tap toswitch or something it's something liketap to something it's like the bottomoption but when you do that now when youhave your always on display see I couldhave this throughout the day and thenwhen it's night time just so that it'snot as bright and you know less light Ican just literally oh it's night timetime for bed boom shut that down or youknow if I feel like battery drain whichI think is only a difference of twopercent whether I choose a blackbackground or a lighter background butif I want to save that extra two percentsay I forgot my charger or something andI'm chilling or I'm just pushing thosetwo days Plus or whatever with this um14 pro Max because the battery can dothat we'll talk a little bit more aboutbattery because there's some truths andsome things I gotta get out aboutbattery that I think a lot of us werewrong in our perception when it comes tothe 14 pro Max's battery butnevertheless yes the always on displayfrom a design standpoint and a newfeature set is absolutely fire thisalways on display is the bestimplementation of always on display andguess what it even uses less batterypower and battery drain than the onealways on display that I thought waseven better and that's Samsung's I'veLoved Samsung's always on display tothis date but in many of tests thealways on display on Samsung's devicesdrains more battery which goes into uhefficiency and optimization and thingslike that butyou know it's not a huge difference butthere is a difference with the iPhone 14pro Max taking the slight Edge so justreally well thought out and really welldone shout out to Apple for how they didtheir always on display it's just thoselittle extra developer thoughts andcreativity that just adds to thisoverall experience again like I saidthat iOS 16 experience but that alwayson display is only on the 14 pro Max andnot the 13 Pro Max so as someone who hadthe iPhone 13 Pro Max and I'm coming tothis 14 pro Max it is an upgrade it's aplus it's fire is it worth spending themoney did it make my user experiencethat much better it did give me a betteruser experience but I don't know if it'slike oh I need to upgrade from the 13Pro max if I'm just being brutallyhonest and straight for it so it's up toyou personally if you feel like thisalways on display is worth your upgradefrom the previous last year's model it'ssomething that you can live without andprobably wait for the 15 to come out youknow the 15 Pro Max but it is a plus andit is a better user experience to haveover last year's model in my opinion nowother things with the Apple displayscolor accuracy this is a beautiful likeI think around 2K ish uh display verypixel dense very beautiful very vibrantand very bright this has a max knitbrightness of 2000 nits which slightlyedges out the Samsung s22 Ultra at 1750.you know it's Tit for Tat in that sensebut that little slight edge of 2000 nitsespecially versus the 1200 nits of the13 Pro Max which I gotta be honest whenI put those out in direct sunlight youguys saw it uh in direct harsh harshsunlight which I put them in uh the 13Pro Max Held his own in comparison tothis device I'm not sure if there's somekind of coding shading the apple doeswith their displays alright so let'stake a look at Apple's display this isthe always on display with a darkerbackground in direct sunlight as youguys can see it is quite visible now ifI unlock it you guys really get to seethe display and how visible it is withthat 2000 nit Max brightness this isdirect sunlight just to show you as youcan see the sun is directly shining andyou're able to see it just fine all inall overall from day to day especiallyindoors this display and this new knitsof brightness and just the vibrancy ofit is definitely an upgrade overprevious models and in specifically tothe iPhone 13 Pro Max now is that worthan upgrade personally I don't think so Idon't think you go from the 13 Pro Maxjust to get 2000 nits of brightness orto get you know this display set up Idon't think that that's worth theupgrade now from a user experienceperspective I'm lovingthe brightness and the vibrancy and thecolor accuracy of this display from dayto day use I appreciate it now anotherthing in this display design that we gotto talk about and that's that pill shapethat Dynamic Island now this issomething that's exclusive to the 14 proand 14 pro Max that you can't get on the13 Pro Max via software iOS 16. and thisis what I'm speaking on when I say thatiOS 16 in combination with these newphysical changes on the 14 pro Maxcreates a different user experience nowwhether or not that's better is totallysubjective but let me just be honest andshare my opinion the dynamic island isabsolutely fire if I were to go let mesee let me go set a timer a timer realquick right let's say I start this fiveminute timer so now everything that I doand everything that I continue to do onmy device allows me to still monitorthis software running in the backgroundso if this is an important timer whichfor me personally when I'm working andI'm editing and I'm trying to cook Iburn things so the plus and the benefitto this whole dynamic island is justbeing able to monitor an app running inthe background while doing somethingelse so I'm here I'm looking at I guessthe uh resellers right here showing offblase blah I'm like hey yo I need to dosomething with this let me pause it orlet me end it without interrupting mycurrent user experience and so forth soI'm absolutely gratefulfor a lot of the features that come withthe dynamic Island like if I were toneed to go into something that needsface ID like this okay let's say face IDright boom you see the animation rightthere happening and also I love it forthe apps because it just creates likethis little square right there like sayif I need to go in hereI hit the littlethat animation y'all can't see thatthough relaxso from a user experience perspectiveDynamic Island adds to the iOS 16experiencenow is that feature set and notconvenience worth an upgrade as aniPhone 13 Pro Max user with iOS 16.personally I'm gonna say not really it'sgreat it's a benefit it is a plus toyour user experience but I don't know ifit warrants an upgrade unless you gotthe dollars to spend and you know thingslike that that's another topic we'lltalk about that at the end Dynamicisland is fire it's great it has afuture but this is just the beginning sohey if I were to wait as an iPhone 13Pro Max owner for the iPhone 15 Pro Maxnothing wrong with that or if I want tojust say hey I want to get the 14 proMax now and I don't want to wait nothingwrong with that either so I just want tobe clear on that Dynamic Island wasextremely clever shout out to the Appledevelopers that thought of this and uhprogram for it I appreciate it superfire attack iPhones are known for theirperformance let's just be honest thebionic chips that they put in here theseSOC architectures that they've builtupon which are now revolutionizing theirComputing Department I have multiple M1M2 Apple laptops and um iPads anddevices that I've tested but the firstplace we ever saw the performance ofthat style of Chip was in the iPhoneit's been year after year the top of thetop is one of the best gaming experiencefor those who do gaming on mobiledevices it's just really a greatwell-performing device and the fact thatApple has its hands on every bit of theyou know manufacturing process as far asthe design physicallyto the battery and the efficiency andthe software having a stronghold on howeverything works and having in astandard to that that's what just addsto the overall performance and that'swhat adds to the efficiency in that theuser experience and a lot of peoplemight wonderyou know if you have a 13 Pro Max goingto the 14 pro Max performance wise Imean come on now come on let's be realyou're probably not gonna notice thedifference in the performance it's justgoing to feel the same this phone feelsthe same as my 13 Pro Max performancewise now efficiency wise there'ssomething that we got to talk about interms of battery life which since I'vekind ofyou know open the can of worms we mightneed to go there and this is a sectionwhere I was slightly wrong andthere's another section where we werewrong that we're going to talk about butlet's talk about battery life when itcomes to the 14 pro Max the reason whythis is such a strong topic and a strongarea of focus is because the iPhone 13Pro Max set the record is set thestandard extremely high now with the 14pro Max you expect for that to be thesame or betterthere's some new features and there'ssome new things happening on the 14 proMax that kind of brings it slightlyunder the 13 Pro Max I'm talking about acouple of percentages and so forth whenit comes to battery life let's just getstraight to the chase as a userexperience standpoint for me using thisdevice every day it feels the sameI don't feel any less or any worse ofbattery life now in the beginning it wasrough because iOS 16 wasn't quiteoptimized they've since released newupdates which right now let's see wherewe are because they Apple like literallyjust did one so right now as you can seeI'm at iOS16.0.3 so that's the software that we'reat Apple was able to smooth out a fewbumps in the road with this update andthere's more updates to come that smoothit out even more so I do see the futureof this iPhone 14 pro Max battery lifebecoming like even kill with the 13 ProMax so from an upgrade Viewpoint in youknow perspective as the iPhone 13 ProMax user as I said I don't feel anydifference from a everyday userexperience not thinking about myprevious user experience from the iPhone13 Pro Max this battery life isphenomenal it's the top of the line ofall flagships on the market right nowlisten to put it in proper perspectivethe iPhone 4 14 pro not the pro Max hasa battery life that can outdo Samsung'ss22 Ultra which is their 5 000 milliamphour battery big display big device liketheir top of the line Flagship can bebeaten battery life-wise from everydaytabs with a 14 pro so what do you thinkthe 14 pro Max is going to doyou know from a competitive standpointagainst everyone that's out on themarket that's in this Flagshipperspective right here until I've testedI haven't yet to test the pixel 7 ProI'm waiting on that one this is thebattery life King and I expect that tocontinue if battery life is somethingthat you're really into and you like theidea of not being Tethered to chargingdevices and charging cables and beingable to be a little bit more relaxedabout your charging like I chill out onmy charging like I woke up midday todayI had like 20 I was like all right letme top it off and now I'm going to bechilling for the next couple of dayslook look at me I'm at 99 right now Icharge this thing up hours agobattery life now let's get into what alot of people love and know about theseiPhones to be one of the best on themarket and that's the cameras but beforewe get into the cameras I got to tellyou guys about today's video partnerepidemic sound because in a world ofcameras in the world of creating in theworld of content creators and USuploading you know content with thesevery cameras to places like YouTubeInstagram Twitter twitch Facebook TickTock all of these places and that's whatepidemic sound comes into play they makeit extremely easy you go to theirwebsite you search for whatever style ormood or type of song or foli art orsound effect that you need and you findexactly what you need and it goes evendeeper than that if you find a certainsong or artist that you like you canclick on find more similar and it has analgorithm that can bring you songs thatare similar to the one you like and thenyou can create like a playlist but evenmore than that their library is one ofthe biggest not possibly the biggest onthe market when it comes to musiclicensing and royalty-free music royaltyfree means hey you pay them a smallmonthly fee which I'm erasing for thefirst 30 days for you via the link downin the description below and you haveaccess to their entire library and itgets even deeper than this say you finda song that you like not only can youdownload the full song but you candownload the stems to the song meaning Ican download the drum track the flutesthe pianos and the vocals and I canseparate or reuse and mixing mingle andmute whatever I want or don't wantwithin that song so that takes the useof that said sound composition to thenext level and that's what thecompetitors don't have which is why youneed to have epidemic sound via the linkdown description below get a 30 day freetrial now now back to these cameras onthe iPhone 14 pro Max and for thissection I think I'll take it outsideit's fallthe Beloved iPhone 14 pro Max cameras oriPhone cameras shall I say because atthe end of the day even though this isthe 14 pro Max and physically a lot ofthings are different this is the frontfacing camera which I'm using right nowand Here Comes the Sun from under thatcloud the processing is quite similarit's like the iPhone camera app is alsoanother side of the camera to allsmartphone cameras the camera app andthe software and how it processes saidimage plays a huge factor into how setimage looks which is exactly why I thinklike when you look at the iPhone 13 ProMax versus the 14 pro Max not much looksdifferent per se like just in like thecoloring and the processing but thetruth is in the details so like when youzoom in and you look at the fine detailsthat's where you see the differences andalso like the low light performance andthings like that but let me flip to thatnew 48 megapixel wide angle rear camerawhich is the topic of discussion as wellas the ultra wide we'll do both of thoseso this camera right hereis the new camera that was the focus ofthe topic of discussion at Apple'sKeynotes48 megapixels you know it's all pixelbinding and whatnot but larger sensormore light better performanceessentially but I like the naturalbackground blur that you get out of boththe 13 Pro Max and 14 pro Max I likethis rear camera especially for likeshooting like little b-roll of likeproducts and things like that like itcomes in clutch a lot for me and contentand things like that but it just goes toshows that I can substitute it anytime Isee iPhone footage I know it but it'susable and a lot of creators use it andit's extremely possible and that's whythey will lean towards the iPhonecreation because it's not just thecameras it's also the microphone themicrophone on the iPhones capturesreally well for what they are you know Imean this is a smartphone at the end ofthe day this is a phone more intendedfor just capturing moments uploading thesocial mediaand you know doing whatever Phoneactivities you need to do it's like yourSidekick computer and so forth but thisis that rear wide 48 megapixel now I'mgoing to switch to the ultra wide boomnow we have the ultrawide babyyou know what a lot of people might tryto use when vlogging or vloggingthemselves just so that they know thatthey're in the shot because I can't seemyself again which is why I can't waittill Apple gets into the foldable phonemarket but I totally understand whythey're not in it yet topic for anotherday but uh when that technology getsrefined and then Apple finally jumps inwe'll have the Apple cameras with thebenefits of foldable devices withdisplays so that we can see ourselveswhile filming on these rear cameras butuntil then you just gotta either do itblind or use the front facingall right we just came back in fromoutside taking a look at these iPhone 14Promax cameras now let's be real I'mgonna get straight to it no fluff whenit comes to this perspective of someonewho had an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I'mmoving into this 14 pro Max camera wiseeven though there are physicaldifferences there are new sensors it'sgoing to feel very much similar and thesame especially for you in everydayconsumer now me since I'm wearing thecameras and you know I can be you knowuh you know a pixel Peep and snob wellnot really I'm not on that level butnevertheless I use cameras I usehigh-end cameras so I can see thedifference and I can notice itfor those people even the average normalconsumer if you take a look and you diga little bit you'll notice it hasimprovedis that worth an upgrade from the 13 ProMax I don't know I don't think you'regonna feel like going into these camerasensors like oh wow so much differentbut then again if you know what to lookfor and you understand cameras andCamera sensors and what's happeningbetween the photos then you're going tobe like it is so user experience wisejust flat out someone who's not comingfrom the 13 Pro Max oh these cameras arefire they're really really good theylook really great you guys know I tellyou guys year after year that I love theiPhone cameras as far as the balancebetween the collective of photo andvideo now there is a king out there andthere is a you know competitor thatRivals these cameras and that's thepixel which we're waiting on the pixel 7Pro Now video will probably droppingtomorrow or something I'm not gonna youknow let's just say but all in all lovethese cameras do I think they're worththe upgrade year over year I wouldn'tsay so but if you're coming from thoseolder devices oh you're gonna love itall of my three year four year five yeariPhone users oh this is gonna hit foryou for real let's get into thediscussion that matters the most overallI can go on and on about this and thatand the other but the number one thingthat matters and that every contentcreator and reviewer and person speakingon this device should bring to theForefront is user experience becausethat's what matters I spend my hardearned however much this Promax startsoff at 1099the model that I have now is the 1199model and it can go up even higherdepending on how much storage you chooseand you want when I spend that hard andearn money on this 14 pro Maxwhat do I get as a user in my everydayexperienceyou know am I going to love my displaywhen I look at it every day and Iconsume content on it the only gripefrom a user perspective with this newpill shape and it being lower is thatvideos are in two to one aspect ratiowhich is the style of videos that I putout so that you don't have to likestretch it to get the full thing and ifyou do stretch it you don't lose a lotof information but every content creatordoesn't do that the standard uh ratio is16 by nine which won't cut into thispill shape if you're not watching Ultrawide content if you're not watchingcontent that's two to one like mines andyou're watching the typical content thisDynamic Island isn't anything toobstruct your visual you know viewingexperience but slightly different thanthe notch in the sense that when itcomes to two to one so I just want topoint that out display perspectivelooking at this every day the vibrancythe brightness the clarity love it it'sgreat for your user experience they'reprobably going to keep this design for awhile you know I mean I'm pretty surethey order their parts in bulk andthey're going to let those parts run inbulk until it's so low and then they'llswitch that's why I think the upgradesdon't come as quick with apple I justthink they're more on the business sidelogistically wise per se this is just mytheory you know I mean build quality youguys already know fire you're gonna lovethat every day these cameras for mepersonally I like the improvements and Ithink you will too as an everyday userum the always on display I'm loving thisnow like At first like I said I wasn'tthat big about it because I just thoughtit was too bright but after learning howto use it and having things like youknow just tap the switch where I canjust switch it there or if I want alittle bit more uh I could just add thatlittle slight gray like you know alittle grunge look or you know I couldjust do this beautiful sunset on thewater in the beach you know a Vibe Ilove the information that I'm getting Ilove being able to watch these stocksseeing my uh what is this Apple watchUltra battery life which is a greatcompanion to the 14 pro max if I mustadd and then you know I got the weatherI can see the current the low and thehigh all with the glance am I always ondisplay also you do get a preview ofyour notifications down in the bottomwhich I like I like the way the Applehave their notifications big and boldand very visible and literally you justtap the Wake it take a look you can haveyour privacy uh reveal them and thingslike that that's another thing that ILove About Face ID and the userexperience and just having that to whereno one can't just look at my device andsee my stuff now I know that this iscrossed over the others have followedvia their Touch ID and so forth but allI have to do is look I don't have totouch or anything not that it's aninconvenience to touch but the truth andthe fact of the matter is when it comesto user experience the user experienceis honestly iOS 16 with some physicalchanges to help complement iOS 16 butit's iOS 16 and iOS 16 is really goodit's really dope and is a great userexperience from day to day so when itcomes to the iPhone 14 pro Max for thosepeople who are wondering should Iupgrade from the 13 Pro Max to this andam I going to fill an upgrade youprobably won't for my people who areolder iPhone users and want to upgradeinto this you will feel the upgrade andfor people who have never used an iPhoneand kind of curious and you've heard somuch about the battery life and theexperience the 14 pro Max is definitelythe way to go[Music][Music]thank you
qWIkBMNKj1s,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,[Music]so what do the early 2000s san antoniospurs and the current day phoenix sunsand the galaxy s 22 series all have incommonwell they're all drama-free they're allkind of a bit boring and all quietlyreally really goodso those spurs weren't really just aone-trick pony of being more athletic ordunking all over the top of people orjust shooting tons of three-pointers orreally any of the things that a casualfan would immediately appreciate justgood solid fundamentals ball movementhigh percentage shots and sharing theload same kind of thing with the phoenixsuns of today they don't necessarilyhave one huge standout mvp superstar butlike the whole team is really reallygood and there aren't really anyweaknesses and they're quietly thenumber one team in basketball this phoneis boring like i'm not the only onewho's thought that and said that butthat's what happens when a phone gets soreally good across the board that therearen't really any weaknesses becausethey didn't really take any huge risksthey just took a good thing and made itbetter so i appreciate that you knowwhat you're getting with a samsungflagship very similar design to lastyear just a little bit smaller and alittle more squared off and with glasson the back now instead of plastic thatlittle spot where your finger restsunder the camera bump too if you use itwithout a case it's a little more sharpbut i got used to that pretty quicklybut we all expect an ip68 waterresistant phone solid speakers clickybuttons the best ultrasonic fingerprintreader in the game a nice satin finishyou know not all of these things can besaid about every other phone but they'reall here and i even want to give a shoutout to the in the hand feel of thesmaller galaxy s22 so i talk about inthe hand feel all the time but samsungmade both of these phones smaller thanlast year the s22 plus went from 6.7inches to 6.6 diagonally still big butthen the smaller s22 went from 6.2 to6.1 inchesanddare i say it has a bit of a compactfeel to it now obviously it sounds crazyto say that about a phone that still hasa six inch screen but the fact that i'mcoming from bigger phones combined withthe flat sides and the tiny symmetricalbezels and the corner to corner displaythis has me feeling like it's about ascompact as the phone can possibly be andi'm almost tempted to have it in therunning for maybe compact phone of theyear maybe it just holds that lead forright now in february but speaking ofdisplays that's the one thing that wedefinitely know samsung two have beengood at for a long time this year thoughthere was a bit of confusion around themso let's clear that up so both the s22and s22 plus have flat 1080p 120 hertzadaptive ammo led panels the plus isobviously bigger and it also has thehigher max brightness of1750 nits where the s22 gets up to avery respectable 1300 nits they're bothvery viewable outdoors although the peakbrightness on the bigger phones and alsothe ultra is crazy bright like you canview it in direct sunlight it's awesomebut there was a question about whetherthese were ltpo displays or not sothat's that newer tech that allows youto modulate the display refresh ratedown to 10 hertz to save battery so i'dask samsung and i mentioned this in theimpressions video that they told me thatthese are not ltpo displaysbut then at the same time on the specsheet it also said that these go from 10to 120 hertz so that was a bit confusingbut now a few days later if you checksamsung's actually changed those specsheets and their website saying it cango from 48 to 120 hertz so theyclarified that data transfer rates tothe display can go as low as 10 hertzbut the display is still refreshingfaster so they updated their site toreflect the widely recognized industrystandard of the actual refresh rate huhit's almost like some other companiessometimes lie to people by expressingthings in other non-standard waysanyway so it's not the full variablerefresh rate range of ltpo2 like we haveon the ultra which is a bit of adownside to an 800 to a thousand dollarphone but aside from that it's a greatbright responsive display in thisadaptive mode and that's what mattersmost to me i did notice there's stillsome situations and still a few appswhere it kicks down to 60 hertz onpurpose like maps apps like waze andgoogle maps and still the galaxy storeapp for some reason but with all thecolor customization and a really goodauto brightness the only possibledownside with this screen would bebattery life and on top of that the onlyconcern for me really going intoreviewing these phones was the batterylife because number one both the phonesare smaller and so both of them have a300 milliamp hour smaller battery thanlast yearand number two the new snapdragon 8 gen1 chip had some concerns about it it'sthat's obviously brand new and supposedto be very efficient but it also appearsto be geared to be a very high-end chipvery high performance so it performsreally well puts up great numbers betterthan previous chips on benchmarks and itcrushes gaming but it runs a little hotand if there's a reason almost everyflagship you see coming out with thisnew chip also has like a huge section intheir presentation about their newmassive super innovative new coolingsolution so with no ltposmaller batteries and a potentiallyhigher power drawing chip i was a littleconcerned about battery life on thesephonesturned out to befinenot amazing not like headline making butsan antonio spurs boring levelgood so david was testing the s22 plusmost at the studio and got a solid dayand a half of use so starting a day at 700 am and then getting to 1 pm the nextday before the battery dies pretty solidand i was using a smaller s22 for a fewdays and had no problem ending a normalday with 10 to 20 percent left now if idid a lot of high brightness navigationand gaming big power draw stuff i couldtake big chunks out of this battery fastso that did not surprise me with thischip it is a more efficient fournanometer process node now so it doesreally well with standby but you canabsolutely burn through it with heavyuse something to keep in mind too thoughthe s22 plus has a better overallbattery experience because it alsosupports 45 watt fast charging insteadof the 25 watts on the smaller phone nowit doesn't come with it so it's 50 bucksextra to get that 45 watt charger butthat's a difference to note you wannaknow something i did find i like lessabout the s22 though than last year it'sa subtle one but it's real the vibrationmotorso the haptics are still actually reallygood and really strong and clicky andresponsive and i love that about it butthey've switched from a z-axis vibrationmotor to an x-axis vibration motorit doesn't sound like it make a hugedifference but that's a difference inthe direction of the pulsing of themotorand that makes it a lot less strong inmy pocket and on a table for feeling thevibrations i missed a lot ofnotifications just because it didn'tstrongly buzz me enough[Music]so yeah i don't know that was a subtlething you can still feel the vibrationsreally well and turn vibration intensityall the way up but the direction isdifferent not sure why maybe spacesavings but it's real maybe the mostexciting potential superstar upgrade onthese phones though isthe cameras the s22 having a majorcamera upgrade would be like the 2016golden state warriors signing kevindurant making them the clear number onefavorite right you have a new 50megapixel main camera a 10 megapixel 110degree ultra wide and another 10megapixel 3x telephoto camera but thisnew camera system is moreharrison barnes than kevin durantmeaning it's it's really good but it'snot gonna blow your mind at how good itis i love that we take photos this goodfrom a smartphone for granted you giveit pretty much any normal lightingsituation and handles it really wellsamsung's colors are nicely balancedthey've hit their stride with processingthat isn't too overly sharp or saturatedthe ultrawide is definitely softer thanthe main camera but it still does wellwith a lot of light and the telephoto isrock solid no weird hdr haloing issuesand pictures no white balanceinconsistency problems no auto focusissues and pretty minimal shutter lagit's justboring tim duncan with the bank shotlevel solid also i i gotta say i lovethat it no longer punches into 3x when ishoot 8k video on the phone i know akvideo is not the most popular featurebut last time the higher resolutioncamera was the telephoto so if i shot 8kvideo it would punch into a 3x cropthat was rough it doesn't do thatanymore now it's just a tiny crop in onthat main sensor which is actually asmaller crop than on the ultra becausethe ultra is cropping into the middle 33megapixels of this massive 108 megapixelsensor so i'd actually rather shoot 8kvideo on the regular s22s than the s22ultra now i'm not going to do it becauseit's still 24 fps whichis the wrong frame rateshopped.onbc.com but still like whycouldn't samsung add a little switch tomake it 8k 30 if i wanted to the lastthree snapdragon chips have been able tosupport 8k 30fps video and i know youknow 8k is supposed to be a super highend cinematic feature but at leastburied in the settings let me do ak-30if i want toi don't know maybe it's a samsung thingother phones have been able to do itnot samsung now there are way moresoftware improvements with these cameraslike night photography which samsungcalls knightography because they have toname everything for some reason butthat's for better detail and night shotsand ai stereo portrait mode improvementsfor better cutouts and space zoomstability locking and auto framing thatcan track up to 10 faces around a frameand a new separate expert raw app i'mgoing to talk way more about all thiscamera stuff in the s22 ultra reviewvideo which is coming soon definitelymake sure you subscribe to see that onewhen it comes out but in this one iwanted to talk about its default statuswhich you know especially in the u.snow it's kind of a running joke thatoutside of the tech community we'veheard people call it like iphones andgalaxies like they've just been sodominant here anyway that it's kind ofalready understood but especially withthe s22 series now more than ever it'ssort of solidified itself as the defaultandroid phone uh which is crazy when youconsider what the pixel 6 was supposedto be now i used to rag on samsung'ssoftware for being incredibly clunkyweighted down with bloatware lookinglike a cartoon skin on top of androidwhile the pure google experience from anexus or a pixel or even a lightweightskin from motorola or oneplus was theway to go but today now that oxygen oshas gone downhill and the pixels are abuggy mess samsung's one ui has evolvedinto easily one of the most stableperformant feature-packed androidexperiences out there they loop in thegoogle stuff when it's good like havinga google page next to your home screenand the new material you wallpaperpicker from android 12 which lets youpick colors from your wallpaper to beaccent colors and the menus of yourphone but then they also sprinkle intons of their own samsung features thatyou can decide to use if you want butnot only that samsung has also vaultedahead and is doing some things betterthan google's own phones so one thingthat i've noticed is there's a newgoogle messages app as the default onall these samsung phones which is coolif you go to the play store and try todownload google messages it says youalready have it installed but when youopen it it's a samsung skinned versionthey're the only ones who have been ableto do that so now it has that halfscreen reachable ui to match the rest ofsamsung's one ui then there's a newgoogle duo feature that launched whereyou can essentially watch a youtubevideo together with someone while on avideo call like apple did with shareplay over facetime and this feature haslaunched in google duoon the galaxy s 22s only firstwhy so you have to use a galaxy s22 ors22 ultra to use this feature which idid we tried it and it worked but thereis no timeline for when this featurewill show up on other android phonesincluding google's own pixeleven though google made this feature andthen on top of that samsung is promisingfour years of software updates for thegalaxy s22s after they launchthat's more than the three years ofsoftware updates that google ispromising with their own phone in thepixel you see what i'm getting at so thegalaxy s 22s are boring yes but theboringness comes from them havingbasically no glaring flaws and makesthem incredibly easy to recommend i wishthey were more sustainable i wish theyincluded a charger in the box so youdidn't have to go out of your way to buya 45 watt charger and make more waste toactually use that feature and i canappreciate that some plastics being usedin the phone are made from recycledfishing nets but that's really only atiny dent in the big picture ofsamsung's footprint but in that classicfrequently asked question of like ifyou're in the market for a flagshipphone right now and i don't knowanything about youthe first phones that i'm gonna bring upare the iphone 13 and the galaxy s 22plusand they've earned that spotthat's been it thanks for watching catchyou guys the next onepeace
C8Axygwyweg,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,samsung's galaxy s22 lineup featuressome of this year's premier flagshipphones and the one that we'll talk abouttoday is the small one the regulargalaxy s22 samsung seems to be going forconsistency rather than breaking themold so there aren't very many surpriseshere still let's see what the s22 has tooffer in our full review[Music]even though it might seem like thelowest tier s22 model under the plus andthe ultra if you're after a compactflagship the vanilla s22 could be theway to gothe design is similar to last year's s21but this year's model is a bit smallerand even easier to wield in one handanother difference is that rather thanhaving a plastic back the s22 has a backpanel made of gorilla glass victus plusthe frame is armor aluminum here and ofcourse you get ip68 rated water and dustresistance like we've seen from samsungflagships for quite a while nowthe galaxy s22 is built around a flat6.1 inch amoled display which has a1080p resolution gorilla glass victusplus like the back and a fast 120hzrefresh ratethe refresh rate smooths out themovements and animations on screen andit's adaptive based on your activity tosave energy it can't dial down as low asthe s22 ultra but we did see it go downas low as 24 hertzcontent looks sharp and contrasty onthis screenwell it isn't quite as advanced as thepanels that you'll find on the plus orultra models it's still very competitivethere's hdr 10 plus support and colorscan achieve great accuracy throughsettingsmax brightness is great on the s22 withthe new extra brightness option andsettings we were able to achieve almost760 nits with a manual slider and thiscan boost up to 980 nits in auto modewhen in bright sunlightthere's also a new feature called visionbooster when auto brightness is switchedon the screen will change the contrastto match the surrounding lights sothings are easier to readunder the displace it's an ultrasonicfingerprint reader it's quite reliableto wake up and unlock the phonethe s22 has a pair of hybrid stereospeakers with dolby atmos supportthe setup earned a score of good on ourloudness charts and the sound quality isgood toowith a wide sound stage and a prettytight frequency response[Music]you can find the galaxy s22 with either128 or 256 gigabytes of onboard storagebut unfortunately it's not expandablebeyond thatthe interface of the galaxy s22 issamsung's one ui 4.1 based on android12.if you've used a samsung phone recentlyit should all look pretty familiarone ui4 does bring a few new tweaks hereand there though mainly stemming fromthe new android versionfor example there are more fleshed outcustomization options for widgets andthere is a privacy dashboard whichallows you to manage all your privacyoptions and permissions from oneconvenient placecolor palettes are also somethingrelatively new you can set the theme ofyour ui to match the color of yourwallpaperoverall one ui 4.1 is smoothcustomizable and samsung is promising alot of supportfour years of os updates and five yearsof security patchesat the heart of the galaxy s22 is one oftwo high-end four nanometer chipsetseither a snapdragon 888 or an exymus2200 depending on the market ours is theexynos variant and that means it has adifferent gpu this one created incollaboration with amdin benchmarks this s22 displays flagshipgrade performance that is notably betterthan last year's model the numbers areeven a bit better than what we measuredfrom the s22 plus and the s22 ultrabecause samsung has rolled out someperformance based updates since thengaming and heavy tasks are no problemhere we did notice some thermalthrottling from the s22 in our stresstest but it ramps gradually which canhelp minimize stuttering in suchscenariosat 3 700 milliamp hours the batterycapacity here is smaller than lastyear's model and battery life isunimpressive the s22 was able to scorean endurance rating of 85 hours in ourproprietary testscharging speed is decent even though thes22 only supports 25 wattswith samsung's 25 watt adapter the phonewent from zero to around sixty percentin half an hourthe cameras of the galaxy s22 are thesame as what you would find on the plusmodelthere's a 50 megapixel main camera withois a 10 megapixel telephoto camera withthree times optical zoom and a 12megapixel ultrawide cameraphotos from the main camera come out at12 megapixels they have solid all-aroundquality with plenty of detail andwell-balanced colors with just enoughpopdynamic range is also stellar thesearen't perfect though the biggest issueis some visible softness particularly indarker areas there's also somenoticeable over sharpening maybe in anattempt to compensateif you're shooting in the main camera'sfull 50 megapixel resolution there is amode called detail enhancer it managesto provide additional detail whilemaintaining consistency in other aspectsof the qualitythree time zoom photos from thetelephoto come out at 12 megapixelswhich means they are slightly upscaledfrom 10.still quality is excellent withimpressive sharpness and detail lownoise and colors that match the maincamera as wellthere's no macro camera here and whilethe main camera doesn't take very goodmacro shots the telephoto actually doesalrightportraits can be taken with either themain camera or the telephotothose from the main camera are excellentwith spot on subject separation thatrarely makes mistakesthe level of detail and the colors arejust as great as the regular photosportraits from the telephoto look goodenough but they're noticeably softerthan

colors are well matchedwith the main cams and while dynamicrange is a bit narrow here it's stillimpressivethere's electronic video stabilizationavailable on all the cameras and does agood job of smoothing out shakiness andmotionin low light 4k video from the maincamera is flagship grade through andthrough detail is great and so is thedynamic range the telephoto camera doesan impressive job in low light as wellthe footage is on the darker side thoughand dynamic range isn't stellarthe ultrawide camera has a tougher timeand low light as expected but this isstill pretty good for this sort ofcamera with enough detailso that's the samsung galaxy s22you get a compact and premium lookingdesign a bright high refresh rate oledstereo speakers a high-end chipset greatcameras and plenty of software supportpretty much what you'd expect from asamsung flagship there are no hugebreakthroughs here or any biginnovations and really it's quitesimilar to last year but that's notnecessarily a bad

x2S77b6mc7U,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,now on the surface samsung's fresh newgalaxy s22 flagship smartphone may seemlike a bit of a half-hearted upgradeover last year's s21 i'm sure it looks awee bit more premium but many of thefeatures will give you a serious senseof deja vu even though the camerahardware has been overhauled and samsunghas tweaked quite a few bits here andthere so the question is is the galaxys22 worthy of a place in your pocketpurse pants wherever you decide to stashit well i've had my sim in there for afull week now using it as my full-timesmartphone so here's my in-depth samsunggalaxy s22 review and for more on thelatest and greatest tech please do pokesubscribe and hit that notificationsbell cheers now one of the few aspectsof last year's s21 that i'm really gladcarried over to this year's model isthat dinky design at a nat's pube oversix inches the galaxy s22 is comfortableto stash in your jeans all day long andeasy enough to use one-handed especiallyas there's actually a one-handed modeand i found i had absolutely no problemswhen it came to usability even when iwas lounging back in bed because thatscreen doesn't cover on the edges of thesmartphone that means that your palmflesh doesn't cause merry havoc wheneveryou're clutching the phone really tightand while yeah the s22 does lack anykind of real flair i do kind of likethat simple design and i am a fan of howthat dinky camera chassis now blends inwith the rest of the back the front andback ends of the s22 are protected bygorilla glass invictus with samsung'sarmor aluminium frame sandwiched inbetween i do get a little bit worriedwherever gorilla glass victus isconcerned because while it is moreshadow resistant than previous versionsof gorilla glass i found that it alsoscratches up rather easily just witheveryday wear and tear and panic levelswere at maximum with the s22 as well asthere's no pre-installed screenprotector on there but thankfullytouchwood so far no scuffs or littlenicks anywhere to speak of and the onlyway you're gonna put a dent in that edgein there is if you actually drop thegalaxy s22 onto a hard floor from quitea height as well i should know becausei've actually done that you've also gotfull ip68 water and dust resistance hereas well so no worries if you want torock at the shower the bathtub jacuzziwhatever you want to do and right nowsamsung is offering the s22 in a smallselection of colors gotta say myfavorite models are that shiny whiteeffort and this here moody green versiontwo i think of the two i am leaningtowards this lovely green effort as thatdark finish does hide grubby prince andgrime rather effectively and it justlooks rather fetching i can't see ireally have much complaints when itcomes to the software running on the s22the latest freshest android 12 of coursewith samsung's one ui 4.1 launchersquatting on top of it and yeah i cansee it's been a flawless experience i'veseen a few weird little quirks and bugshere occasionally i would type in anotification and absolutely bugger allwords happen a couple of apps i've justsaid bollocks to i can't be botheredanymore and shut down in the middle ofme using them but you know a few littlemoments of micro frustration aside thisthing has been well behaved however igotta say the galaxy s 22's haptics areweak source probably a consequence ofthat shrunken stature i'm not evenkidding there's more power in acockroach's pelvic thrust than there isin this weedy little motor still one uiserves up pretty much all the featuresyou'd hoped for in a flagship phoneincluding plenty of opportunities forcustomization a fair few time savingtools like bixby routines and the usualsecurity smarts add an extra protectionon top of android and that ultrasonicfingerprint sensor is a winner as usualit's not bothered one little bit at allif your thumb is sopping wet althoughwe're gonna say the face unlock is a bitall over the place here on the s22sometimes this phone acts like myso-called mates when i bump into themout on the street just pretending it'sgot no idea who the hell i am but kudosto samsung though for offering fourfour os updates over time with thegalaxy s22 so that's got you supportedall the way up to android 16 and you'vegot even longer on the security updateas well but anywho if you'd like to knowmore about the various one ui featureshere on the s22 well definitely checkout my video all about one ui4 it israther spiffin by jove there's a bit ofa shame though that like most of thepremium expensive flagship smartphoneshere on the galaxy s 22 there's noexpandable storage nor micro sd memorycard support at all and that'sespecially annoying if like me you'vegot the basic 128 gig model of the s22because already after just a week of usei'm close to filling two thirds of thatinternal storage not helped by the factthat the system files are frigginmassive and i haven't even downloadedany movies or shows to watch on thatslick 6.1 inch dynamic amoled displaywhen i'm out and about that screen isvery similar to the amoled panel foundon the older s21 except now it's a weebit brighter easily bright enough tocomfortably see stuff while you'rewearing shades on a sunshiny day and itcould also drop to a lower refresh ratenow to save on juice although as we willdiscover later in this review thatdoesn't really seem to have much impacton the galaxy s22 staying power nomourning or griping about the picturequality here though the full hd plusresolution of this compact screen meansfine detail packed into every frame andas usual you can expect vibrant visualsthat properly punch you right in thechops samsung's new vision boosterfeature is on board and this apparentlytweaks the screen color and contrast tomatch environmental light so darkerimages are easier to see personally ican't say i noticed much difference atall over the s21 but even when i waskicking back with some moody marvelshenanigans in a brightly lit room iwasn't scratching my head over what wasactually happening on screen contrast isabsolutely beautiful the viewing anglesare perfect as you'd expect from an oleddisplay as well so top-notch stuff and ihave heard some people complaining thatthe samsung galaxy s22 display is toosmall to comfortably enjoy a movie or ashow on all i can say is that my eyesare and i had absolutely noissues kicking back for a couple ofhours watching a film on this thing trystreaming an entire movie on a bloodyiphone se and then you can complainabout size alright those stereo speakersare crazy loud on top volume althoughthe sound quality isn't too clean onceyou do hit those highs i did enjoystreaming music to my headphones andtrue wireless buds using bluetooth 5.2however with full codec support for zerolatency and the best possible audioexperience now the galaxy s22 is poweredby samsung's own fresh new fournanometer exynus 2200 chipset or atleast it is here in the uk and certainother regions and over the past week theperformance has been absolutely fineapps seem to stay open for absolutelyages in the background and even with acouple dozen running at once it's reallyrare to see any kind of juddes orjitters this said the top end of the s22does get a bit toasty at times forexample when downloading files andstreaming music simultaneously and alsoif you are gaming for a good long whileon something like gentian impact you canexpect this phone to properly warm upyour fingers thankfully i didn't noticeany throttling even with the graphicssettings maxed out and while the s22isn't as capable as many snapdragonagen1 rivals it still packs enough gruntto see you through whatever you needthat screen may be quite compact by 2022standards but it's still sizable andsharp enough to give you a clear view ofthe action when you are gaming onlinewith effectively zero touch lag at leastnone that i noticed anyway of coursesamsung's dedicated gamer tools aren'tas finely crafted or as easy to use asthose found on many other phones andalso sami has promised big things fromits x-clips gpu which is integrated intothat exynos chipset including full raytracing support for mobile games in thefuture but how many games actually takeadvantage of this technology stillremains to be seen no complaints on theconnectivity side though you got fullwi-fi 6 support on 5g naturally and ihad absolutely zero issues whether i wasconnecting to wi-fi networks or 5gmobile networks over the past weekhowever the galaxy s 22 suffers from onecrippling weakness as bad as a dodgelydesigned vent on a death star andsomewhat annoyingly it's the exact samereason that meant i couldn't recommendlast year's galaxy s21 flagshipsmartphone you see packed inside of thes22s compact frame is a very small 3700milliamp hour capacity cell so onceagain it's been non-stop battery warshere on the s22 every single day of thispast week i've been using this as myfull-time phone it's been dead by about9 10 p.m in the evening it's neverlasted a full day on a single charge andit's not even like i've been playinggentian impact non-stop on this thingeven days where i've done absolutely nogaming whatsoever only done you know alittle bit of camera action a little bitof video streaming it still generallydies before i'm all tucked up with teddythat's around four to five hours ofscreen on time and yes a lot of compactsmartphones unfortunately do suffer fromthe same battery life wars but you knowif you do want a compact handset thatcan last you a full day easily thendefinitely check out something like thexiaomi 12 which easily makes it througha full day even with plenty of hands-onaction and as usual the charging speedsaren't anything to write home about hereon the s22 you've got 25 watt widecharging 15 watt wireless charging sopretty poultry compared with a lot ofbig chinese rivals certainly which tendto offer more like sort of 66 80 100watt charging these days now if thathasn't completely put you off you'restill intrigued by the s22 well let'scheck out that main camera tech which isnow a fresh 50 megapixel sensor thatcamera hardware may be different here onthe s22 now versus the older s21 but notmuch has really changed up in terms ofthe actual photo and video quality foryour photos yeah the s22 does stilloccasionally boost those colors to makea scene look more appealing but not asbad as some samsung blows of the pastthis phone is fantastic when it comes tocapturing action shots of kids cats andother mobile subjects the shutter speedis generally fast enough to tap and snaplots of picks in quick succession unlessyou're snapping away in low light thatis in which case you'd be waiting a goodcouple of seconds for each image to becaptured and processed still the galaxys22 generally cops well with stronglight and contrast i only really saw anyreal saturation when i was practicallyshooting into the sun and when you moveindoors or to darker areas the s22 stillcopes well capturing enough finer detailso your photo will look good when youchuck it up onto a tv or monitor tin isgood in low light as the pixel 6 seriessmartphones or the oppo find x5 seriesas well but it'll do the job the primarycamera sensor is once again joined by a12 meg ultra wide angle lens which doesas well as expected proven up to thetask of snapping more dramatic resultsand while the 10 meg telephoto shooterwith a three times optical zoom isn't apatch on the ultra's space zoomshenanigans it's still very handy forgetting closer to your subject withoutdisturbing them but of course thiswouldn't be a samsung smartphone withoutlike a gajillion different bonus cameramodes that portrait mode is asimpressive as always allowing you toadjust the severity of the bucket afteryou take the shot although the edgedetection does occasionally get a bitjanky my personal favorite however isstill that single take mode which isgreat when your kids or pets are up tosomething this not only captures a shortvideo clip but it also serves up avariety of filtered picks andcomedically bizarre gift style effortsthat are highly shareable standard videocan be captured at up to 8k resolutionwhich is a hit and miss affair i preferkeeping the s22 at ultra hd level with achoice of 30 or 60 frames per secondfilming picture quality is really greateven with lots of motion in the shot andonce again the visuals aren't tootroubled by tricky conditions like highcontrast scenes audio is clearlycaptured from all directions and evenwhen things were a bit breezy that soundwasn't distorted much at all overall topstuff although the oppo find x5 stillhas a beat in low light and last up thes22 serves up another 10 meg selfie camwhich may have a low megapixel countcompared with many rivals but i washappy enough with the results processingtimes are again long in low light butyou don't end up with much grain andthere's enough room to fit in plenty ofheads when needed and yeah you couldshoot up to 4k resolution video usingthat front facing selfie camera as wellthe uhvideo quality doesn't quite look as goodin 4k as does from that rear camera butit's certainly possible for just asimple bit of vlog action or whateverand the audio pickup's pretty good evenoutdoors the wind distortion isn't toobad at all so all right there's my fullfinal frank review of samsung's freshgalaxy s22 flagship smartphone and igotta say it does feel like a seriouscase of deja vu not just because it's anincremental upgrade over the s21 butalso because that lackluster batterylife makes the s22 about as appealing assatan's armpit okay so that's probably alittle bit harsh on the galaxy s22 it'sa perfectly fine flagship smartphone idid enjoy using it this past week whenit wasn't dying on its arse i gotta saythough i do prefer the xiaomi 12. yeahxiaomi doesn't offer the same level ofsoftware support as samsung or the samegreat range of security features butit's just as delightfully dinky and thexiaomi 12 also boasts flawlessperformance and much better battery lifeso anyhow that's my review what aboutyou guys have you've been using the s22as your full-time smartphone it'd begreat to hear your thoughts down in thecomments below especially if you'reusing that snapdragon model which youget over in the us uh versus this exynosmodel i've heard the snapdragon model isa bit better when it comes to thebattery life so that would be great hereplease do poke subscribe and ding thatnotifications bell for more on thelatest and greatest second haveyourselves a bloody lovely rest of theweek

vNxyOhyPGEs,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,a portion of this video is brought toyou by asus today i'll be sharing withyou my experience and long-term reviewafter using the samsung galaxy s22 forthe past three months both the good andthe bad to ultimately help you decidewhether the s22 is the right phone foryou as always i will leave all thepurchase links down in the descriptionlet's get to it so first let me tell youwhich model i chose so i opted to go forthe galaxy s22 in 128 gigabytes andchose the phantom black color and thiscomes in at 799or769 pounds and if you've seen myoriginal review video you'll know that ilove the design of the s22 the mattetextured glass back not only looks goodbut also feels comfortable in the handthe matte glass also shows far fewerfingerprints compared to glossy glassand for me has held up really wellshowing no cracks or scratches the shinyaluminum sides of the s22 slightly curveand this makes it easier to grip thoughi wish samsung had made these in thesame matte texture as on the back notonly do i think this would look evenbetter but also the polished aluminum onmy phone has gathered some microscratches around the corners though tobe fair these are hard to spot my onlyreal concern when it comes to durabilitylies in the front glass that is on thedisplay i purposefully didn't use ascreen protector on the s22 to see howit would hold up in real world use andwell you should definitely buy a screenprotector just through regular use mydisplay has gotten quite a few largescratches that are visible and don'tlook great that said this issue is notunique to the s22 and using a screenprotector from day one will largely fixthis i'll leave my recommendation in thedescription for a screen protector assomeone who typically uses iphoneshaving usbc is great i only need to packone charger and one cable to charge allmy tech the buttons on the s22 haveremained tactile and clicky though i dostill think that the side button couldbe a little bit bigger all thingsconsidered the s22 looks sharp feelspremium and has held up well with buildquality comparable to that of the latestiphones though just like with theiphones do make sure you get a screenprotector but let me know in thecomments which design do you prefer thegalaxy s22 or that of the iphone 13.samsung are known for their incredibledisplays and the s22 is no exceptionafter using the s22 i can safely saythat this is the best smartphone displayat its price that i've used thesymmetrical super thin bezels goingaround the display make the phone feelmodern and cutting edge the ultrasonicunder screen fingerprint reader is fastand secure i think this is the best wayto unlock the phone not to mention thesmall pinhole selfie camera is barelynoticeable when watching videos and justusing the phone generally and watchingvideo reading text or just consumingcontent is an absolute joy on the s22colors are vibrant and the display isreally sharp so even smaller text iseasy to read plus being an oled displaythere is high contrast between thelighter as well as the darker parts ofthe screen i'm also happy to report thati've had no issues with burden so farthis can occur with any oled displayover time but using auto brightness andsetting an auto lock timer will go along way to preventing burn-in fromoccurring the display also gets reallybright with up to 1300 nits ofbrightness and this means i can clearlysee the display in all lightingconditions even in direct sunlight greatwhen walking around outside in the hotsummer sun it also has a 120hz refreshrate and this is a feature that i reallyenjoy having making any motion on screenappear extra smooth whether you areswitching between apps or scrollingthrough your instagram feed or playinggames but then if you are say reading astill image of text the display willlower the refresh rate to help preservebattery and well when it comes to thes22 any preserving of the battery iswelcome but more on battery in a sec butfirst let me introduce you to the asuspro art md300 mouse the first mouse tohave the asus dial allowing you tointuitively make quick and precisesetting adjustments in creative appslike photoshop premiere pro lightroomand more additionally the side scrollwheel offers precise and seamlesscontrol in combination with the asusdial for example you can rotate andclick to change brush size saturationand adjust layer opacity and finallythere are three buttons withprofessional grade switches that providetactile clicks the md 300 has an opticalsensor that tracks at up to 4 200 dpifor precision even when used on glassthe battery lasts up to 150 days on afull charge and can get up to 8 hours oflighter use on just a 1 minute quickcharge you can also connect to up to 3devices via bluetooth and switch betweenthem by pressing the pair button tolearn more about the asus pro art mousemd 300 be sure to click the links in thedescription thanks to asus forsupporting the channel now back to thegalaxy s22 so i consider battery to beone of the key pillars in any smartphoneand it is unfortunate to have to saythat in this category the s22 did notmeet my expectations the s22 has asmaller 3700 milliamp hour batterycompared to the 4 000 milliamp hourbattery from the s21 in typicalday-to-day use i found myself gettingaround 5 to 6 hours of screen on timenow for reference on my iphone 13 i get7 to 8 and this difference is crucialfor example during a typical day ofmixed use i end the day at around 6 pmwith 20 remaining on the s22 meaning ican just about get through a full daybut not evening on the s22 whereas on myiphone 13 i can get through a full dayand evening still with battery to sparewith the s22 more often than not i foundmyself topping up throughout the dayusing the 25 watt fast charging as withmore heavy use using the cameranavigation or watching videos batterygoes quick i really wish samsung hadmade the battery life more of a priorityon this otherwise great phone thankfullythough when it comes to performance thes22 more than delivers with itssnapdragon 8 gen 1 chip games photo orvideo editing apps run super smooth toadd to this samsung's one ui is probablythe most stable experience you'll findon android and i found it to in generalperform quite well i especially likeandroid's material u where the color ofthe os will adapt to the color of yourbackground letting you really make thephone your own something reallyimportant to me is that the s22 ispromised to get four years of softwareupdates and support as someone whotypically uses iphones i really like tosee this while it is still no five tosix years that apple provides it isgetting there more than the three yearsthat google gives to their pixel phoneson the back we have a triple lens camerasystem the best of which is the 50megapixel wide angle lens and is alsothe lens that i use most photos aredetailed white balance is accurate inall lighting conditions and colors whileslightly more on the saturated sidestill look fantastic and then when itcomes to video i would say it is stillnot on the level of that of the iphonebut still 4k 60fps footage looks greatwith excellent image stabilization andreliable auto focus though changes inexposure could still be a bit smootherno matter how dark it is samsung'sknightography uses long exposure andcomputational photography to add lightwhere there is none while stillretaining detail in the image creatingfor some pretty spectacular results soafter three months of using the s22 havemy thoughts changed and is it stillworth it at the end of my originalreview video i said the s22 is a phonethat is almost perfect with its premiumdesign best-in-class display impressivearray of cameras fast performance withyears of software support the only partthat falls short is the battery and nowafter months of use not only is thisjust as true it is also a bitfrustrating as this phone really almosthas it all that said if you carry acharger or battery pack then this issueis largely resolved somewhat still thegalaxy s22 at its price remains to be inmy opinion the best all-aroundsmartphone you can buy on the androidside let me know if you have anyquestions as always i will leave all thepurchase links down in the descriptionif you haven't seen them yet i highlyrecommend watching my s22 verse iphone13 comparison video as well as this i'vealso done a review on samsung's siliconeand leather case for the s22 thank youso much for watching guys be sure tolike and subscribe if you've enjoyedthis video and i'll see you in the nextvideo take care
wbHNykn2_n4,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,samsung's galaxy s22 has a great cameraa new look and a smaller screen but isit the right new phone for you here'show to decidethe galaxy s22 is the smallest andcheapest phone in samsung's new lineupit starts at 800 and comes with a 6.1inch screen that's slightly smaller thanlast year's galaxy s21 and considerablysmaller than the other new phone samsunglaunched this year that includes thegalaxy s 21 fe galaxy s22 plus and ofcourse the giant galaxy s22 ultra ifyou're trying to decide which ofsamsung's new phones is right for youthe biggest factors to consider areprice and screen size yes there are manyother differences between these devicesbut price and screen size are definitelythe biggest ones and no matter which newgalaxy phone you buy you're bound tonotice some camera improvementsthe camera is one of the biggest changeson this year's galaxy phones the regulars22 and s22 plus have both been upgradedto a 50 megapixel main sensor which isquite a jump from the s21's 12 megapixelcamera i've spent a couple of weekstesting both the s22 and s22 plus andi've consistently seen improvements incolor and detail and all three newgalaxy phones are also better at takingphotos in the dark i witnessed theseimprovements across the board whencomparing photos taken on the galaxy s22and the galaxy s21 fe look at this photoof a bouquet of flowers the galaxy s22does a better job of keeping the pedalsin focusthe same was true for photos taken withthe telephoto lens the galaxy s22 zoomlens has a slightly sharper resolutionthan the s21 fes and the difference iscertainly noticeable and of course don'tforget about the improvements to lowlight photography this photo was takenin my apartment with all of the lightsturned off and you can tell the galaxys22 just did a better jobbut there is one area where the galaxys21 fe actually did better than the s22the selfie camera the galaxy s21 fe hasa 32 megapixel front camera while thes22 has a 10 megapixel selfie camera asa result the s21 fes photo looks sharperyou can learn more about the galaxys22's camera performance in our fullwritten reviewthe entire galaxy s22 lineup has a brandnew look that looks and feels moreelegant than last year's s21 i didn'tmind the galaxy s21's more metallicfinish but the s22's glass frame justhas a more polished look that you canreally notice when seeing the devices inperson of course none of this matters ifyou just plan to cover it with a casebut some people care about having aphone that doesn't feel cheap if they'regoing to spend close to one thousanddollars the galaxy s22 certainly won'tdisappoint that crowd that's one of thebiggest differences between the galaxys22 and the galaxy s21 fe which is 100cheaper than the galaxy s22 samsunglaunched the s21 fe in january justbefore the galaxy s22 it has a simpledesign that most people probably won'tmind but it does feel bland incomparison to the s22 the galaxy s22 ands22 plus on the other hand are prettymuch identical other than their size thegalaxy s21 fe falls right in between thetwo since its screen is bigger than thes22s but smaller than the s22 plusesthat makes the galaxy s22 feel like theright choice for people who prefersmaller sized phones if you were a fanof the galaxy s10 from 2019you'll probably like the galaxy s22 bothphones are around the same size exceptthe s22 has flat edges so they feelsurprisingly similar the galaxy s22feels a little too cramped for mepersonally after switching from the s22plus especially when typingbut i'm not the audience for smallerphones since i tend to prefermedium-sized devicesbut i do think that this is one of thebest executions of a smaller device thati've seen yet it's just a hair thinnerand lighter than the iphone 13 but hasthe same size screen when it comes todisplay quality not much has changedsince last year the galaxy s22 has anamoled screen just like the galaxy s21and s21fesamsung also added a new feature calledvision booster which is supposed tomatch the display to the lighting inyour surroundings but i didn't noticemuch of a difference when using thegalaxy s22 lineup alongside the galaxys21[Music]the entire galaxy s22 lineup runs onqualcomm's new snapdragon 8 gen 1processor performance is just what you'dexpect from a new phone apps runsmoothly the interface feels slick andthe camera launches quickly it alsoscored slightly higher than the galaxys21 fe in benchmarks that test generalcomputing performance and graphicsperformance but processor upgrades aremore about new features than rawperformance these days it's part of whythe galaxy s22 can take better photoscompared to the phone's predecessors allthree new galaxy devices also have a120hz display which also makes them feela bit faster the galaxy s22 isn't thebest when it comes to battery life butit'll probably last long enough to getyou through a full day it lasted for 15hours and 21 minutes during cnet'sbattery test which involves continuouslyplaying video in airplane mode that's alittle shorter than the galaxy s21 fesbattery test results and much shorterthan the galaxy s22 ultra and s22 plusboth of which lasted for more than 18hours[Music]the galaxy s22 lineup runs on android 12and samsung's one ui 4.1 software one ui4.1 is a smaller update to one ui4 thebigger system-wide update that launchedin late 2021 it brings refinements to abunch of different areas of samsung'soperating system including widgets andcustom color palettes but one of myfavorites is the switch from icons tonumbers to represent the zoom level inthe camera app the update isn'texclusive to the galaxy s22 but it'snice that buyers will have it right outof the box there's also good news forpeople who don't upgrade their phonesvery often samsung is committing to fourgenerations of android software updatesmeaning your phone won't feel out ofdate too soon[Music]the galaxy s 22's improved camera andfresh design make it feel like a modestbut appreciated update i'd recommendupgrading if you own a phone that's morethan two years old the year-over-yearimprovements are more incremental soit's not worth spending hundreds ofdollars just yet if you're trying todecide which galaxy s22 to buy thinkabout your size preferences and how muchyou're willing to spend the galaxy s22is the best choice for people who don'twant to spend too much and who prefersmaller phones but you'll have tocompromise on battery life the galaxys22 plus is probably the right balanceof size and battery life for most peopleand the galaxy s22 ultra is for peoplewho want the biggest phone possiblealong with other extras like an s penstylus and a better zoom lens but athundred dollars it's one of the mostexpensive phones that samsung sells youmight also be wondering whether youshould buy the galaxy s22 or the galaxys21 fe if you prefer smaller phones anddon't mind paying a little extra for abetter camera the galaxy s22 is theright choice but if you'd rather have abigger screen and save some money checkout the galaxy s21 fe so what do youthink of the galaxy s22 let us know inthe comments and don't forget to checkout the links in the description for ourfull written reviewthanks for watching and i'll see younext time
9hvjBi4PKWA,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,[Music]so[Music]hey what's up mkbhd here and i've beenusing pixel 6 and pixel 6 profor about three weeks nowthis is it this is the first year we'reexpecting a realgoogle flagship right so previous pixelshave been pretty nice and they've hadgreat cameras and pretty cool softwarefeatures but overall pretty lacklusterhardware but thisis a step up we're expecting big thingsa big new camera array a new designlanguage they made their own chipthere's a lot going for it so this istheir moon shot right this is theirchance to compete with the big dogs sonow that i've used them i will say theseare my favorite pixels ever and they arethe most google phones ever made forsure but reality checkthey're not perfect and there'sdefinitely some areas where they come upa little bit short so i'm going to goover those things but off the top i justwant to hit you with the prices firstokay so 5.99 for pixel 6 starting and8.99 for the pixel 6 pro those are bothat 128 gigsthat's really competitive so there's alot of action already at that like 599dollar price range but also the one theykeep calling a flagship which is the sixprothis is the one that's here to takeshots at the iphones and samsung galaxys21 ultras of the world and it competesbut the six is the real deal so i'vegrown to really like this camera bardesign for the pixels and the fact is itis polarizing like it doesn't look quitelike any other phone theoretically youknow the huge new camera sensors needall this thickness here but it couldhave looked like any other phone likethe vivo x70 pro plus has the same 50megapixel sensor but they went with acamera rectangle but this visor it's alook this is the uh the pixel phone looknow it's very easily recognizable and ithink that's on purpose and they cankeep it this way for at least a fewyears and the bar design is functional iwill say my index finger does end upresting nicely underneath the camera barwhen i'm holding it which is nice itdoesn't rock on a table either if you'retyping or using it out of your hand theonly weird part is it doesn't quite likeblend nicely into the aluminum sides ofthis phone like i think it would havebeen really cool if it was like aseamlessblend like one piece like what samsungdid with the s21 ultra but there are alot of seams all over this camera modulebut hey at the end of the day if you'rejust going to toss the case on it likethis grip case from channel sponsordbrand it's basically just going tocancel the bump anywaybut now you've got you know a flat evenphone you've got your icons logos butit's still obviously a pixel underneaththat you still have the visor across theback so i think it's a win unless youthink it's incredibly ugly in which casetry not to look at the back of the phonetoo much but come on visors look coolbut the part you look at on the front ofthe phoneis huge on both screens both of thesephones are huge and i think the thequestion naturally is why didn't theymake a smaller one and i think google'sanswer would bewell there are people who want to spendless on a phone but most of those peoplestill want a big screen so they gave itto him so pixel 6's screen is a prettymassive 6.4 inches from corner to corner90 hertz 1080p and flat and with prettysmall bezels overall and a hole punch inthe top middle for the selfie camerait's a pretty good screen again for a600 phonebut how about that flagship though sowith the 6 pro we're looking at 6.7inches 1440pand up to 120 hertz it is super supersharp very responsive and has been anabsolute pleasure but since they'resaying it's the flagshipi can get a little more nitpicky herethese curved edgesthey're kind of going out of style iknow that gets you even smaller bezelsand they are a little bit smaller butthe fact that it gets kind of a bitdarker in the very corners isn't doingthe screen any favors and there also isa little bit of color shift off axisthat you really straight up just don'tsee on the more expensive screens likeon the s21 ultra or the iphone 13 proalso the fingerprint reader on thedisplay of both of these phonesis kind of slow so it appears to be anoptical sensor shining a light on yourfinger instead of those new ultrasonicones samsung is usingand yeah it's gotten kind of annoyingafter a while often it will take a fulllike half second at least long enoughfor me to get annoyed that i'm waitingfor it to read my finger i think theycould have used a better sensor here orat least done this a little faster i amcomparing it to thousand dollar phonesthough so again this is what i wastalking about earlier it's impressivethat it's hanging with the big dogs butit is just undercutting it a little bitnow the top hole punch in the middle ofthese displays houses the selfie camerait's a pretty decent 8 megapixel widecamera on the pixel 6 but it's closer toan ultra wide selfie on the 6 pro whichi really like a lot and it's also bumpedup to 11 megapixels so it can also shoot4k selfie video fits more people on theframe big fan of the six pros selfiecamera and then also you know the littlethings that you'd sort of expect a greatphone to do well but that you don't wantto have to think about too much likeclicky buttonscheck both phones are fully waterresistant and the haptics are reallygood on both phones as well so that's apixel thing but the biggest new piecegoogle's adding to these phones isdefinitely on the inside and that wouldbe the new tensor chipso designed by google for this phonethis is going to let them do in theorythings that they couldn't do with theoff-the-shelf qualcomm chip they'd usedbefore you know machine learning betterai better computational photography allkinds of things they want to focus onwith just this phonethey can do it and it's done that it'sreally impressive now a lot of peopleare wondering how tensor would benchmarkjustand i don't think that's the right wayto think about this new chip but justout of curiosity i threw a geekbench atit and we have the numbers it got 1035on single core 2800 multi-core so that'smaybe 8 to 10slower with the cpu on paper than thesnapdragon triple eight but also stillway way ahead of the snapdragon 765 gthey used on the pixel five last yearbut then also i did uh some gpubenchmarks from 3dmark and it waslooking at 10 to 12 faster than thesnapdragon triple a but that's clearlynot what tensor is about this this mightbe the biggest this is what makes it agoogly phone this is the biggestdifference betweenthe benchmarks and what the phone isactually capable of that i've ever seenso first of all these phones have beenreally quick and responsive noperformance problems for me i've mostlybeen dailying the 6 pro which has gotthe adaptive refresh rate up to 120hertz and i've been loving that but it'snot about the performance as much asit's about the features and thiscontinues a tradition of the pixel phonebeing the smartest smartphone to comeout every year so you know besides thestuff we've already seen like callscreening where google assistants canfilter incoming calls for you or nowplaying which ambiently detects whateversong is playing in the background inyour environment and just keeps arunning list so you can remember whatsong was going on in the background inthe grocery store an hour ago and we'veseen live captioning of any and allvideos and phone calls and movies inreal time besides all of thatthere is some new improved stuff thanksto tensor and dedicated pieces of thatship so first of all speech to textunreal on this phone absolutelyincredible to the point where itactually changes the way i use the phonei try to use voicemore often on this phone because it's sogood so anywhere i'd normally be typingi use that mic button anywhere i can andno matter how fast you talk you canbasically rap at it you can talk 200words per minute like eminem if you wantto and it'll just keep going quick italso adds punctuation really accuratelyso you don't really even have to thinkabout that you're just automaticallygrammatically accurate all the timethis is going to make sitting inlectures and people in class takingnotes way less stressed and basicallyanywhere else transcription is usefuland even on top of all that it's smartso if you say a name it will pull fromthe names in your contacts try to makesure it spells it right if there'smultiple different spellings of namesfor something and you correct it once itwill remember that corrected spelling ofa name things like that if you saydelete this or sendit doesn't type those words it knowswhat you're trying to do and willactually delete the words or send themessage now there's also a new featurein google photos for pixel six that letsyou go back to any picture in yourlibrary and erase the things that youdon't want now this isn't blowing yourmind if you've seen content aware philon photoshop before but i'm mostlyreally impressed with how easy andsimple it makes the process so you gointo any image go to tools and it'scalled magic eraser and it automaticallyselects what it thinks you want toremove usually a background photo bomberof some sort and then you can just do itand if there's other stuff you want toremove you can draw a sloppy outlinearound it it will auto detect the edgesusually really well with any sort ofcontrast finds the object you're talkingabout and just removes it just like thatso it kind of reads like magic andpeople on twitter loved it but just likephotoshop's content aware feelit has certain things it works reallywell on and other things not so much soit works best with simple repeatingbackgrounds you know maybe gradients ortextures and with a lot of contrastbut if you try to get rid of like alarge object that's in front of severaldifferent backgrounds well that's justgonna look bad like that's difficult forai but i was very impressed with some ofthe things that pulled off just messingaround with it it's probably a gimmickfeature still for most people but thisis yet another demo of the powerful aiand tensor that can be pretty greatsometimes now something i thought wouldbe better with tensoris battery lifeand you know maybe i was getting myhopes up too high becausewhat i saw apple do with their siliconhas been amazing like their chips arebasically the pinnacleof efficiency not to compare too muchbut when i see iphone 13 pro max gettingeight plus hours of screen on time easywith a 4300 milliamp hour batterythat's pretty amazing so now i see pixel6 come out40 600 milliamp hour battery in thepixel 6 and 5 000 milliamp hours in the6 proand they design their own chips so i wasthinking this would be amazingit's not so i was consistently gettingthree and a half to four and a halfhours of screen on time on the pixel 6pro and slightly less on the sixwhich is justaverage at best it's not that great likethat's dead by the end of a long daypretty often now on a 600 phone that'snot too crazy you can probably forgivethat but on a flagshipthat's a weakness and then also on topof that you got to remember there is nocharging brick in the box like we sawand it supports up to 30 watts of wiredcharging which is not super fast butit's it's okay and the wireless chargingthat's supported is even a little bitslower than that so the batterysituation for me has been overall kindof a bummer on the flagship i can getaround it by just charging all the timelike in my car at my desk at workbut you never really want to have to dothat you kind of just want to be able touse your phone normally and not thinkabout it but hey using this phone whenit's not running low on battery has beenawesome thanks to android 12. i want touse it all the time totally made overaesthetic material you and all kinds ofvisual overhaul happening here so i madean entire video about all the newfeatures here which i'll link below thatlike button but yeah i really like mostof it at first it definitely feels likea little spread out like there's a lotof extra blank and like white space inthe ui there's these huge ui elementsand really big buttons and especially ona huge phone with a huge screen it feelskind of cartoonish at first but it allcomes together it's sort of this bigflowing bouncy ui with matching colorsand lots of nice scrolling physics andhaptics it all ties together but yeahit's just nice that no matter whatwallpaper i choose for example the quicksettings and the settings app and allthe menu backgrounds and widgets allfind an accent color in the wallpaperand match it right away it's just it'sso sweet it's nice it's nice my onlylittle gripe with android 12is two things actually one that thebrightness slider is two swipes awayit's all the way at the top and you gotto drag it down i i just think thatcould be way more reachable and way moreaccessibleand the other thing is i don't like thenew internet togglei usually just want to turn wi-fi on oroff but now that takes an extra tapand i feel like they could just add awi-fi toggle in the quick settings butjust a general internet one exists butyou know what when you think about pixelwhat do you think of you think of thesoftware and the camera i think thesoftware is pretty great so let's talkabout the most distinctive part of thisphone the camera so pixels have had thesame camera more or less since the pixel2 right this small 12 megapixel sensoron the pixel 2 was pretty revolutionaryfor its timeand so they kept the same one in pixel3. and then kept the same one in pixelfourand then kept the same one in pixel fiveand it was fine because others werecatching up around them with betterhardware but google had figured out areally great way to compensate for thesmall sensor with incredible softwareamazing computational photography greathdr and multi-frame bracketing and allthis stuff that made their images theirnight sight all of those photos lookincredible it was almost like they justproved with these cameras that thesoftware is more important than thehardware itself but now here we are in2021 everyone's catching up and so nowpixel 6 has launched with a brand newcamera system featuring a much betterhardware suite a huge 50 megapixel mainsensor but you can't actually take 50megapixel photos there's no high resmode or anything for it it's alwaysbinning and everything is down to 12 anda half megapixelsand then there's a new 12 megapixelultra wide and the pro phone also gets a4x telephoto camera as well so okay beenshooting with iti thinkgoogle's still running all of theircamera algorithms at 11 like when theydon't need to anymore so this has muchbetter hardware and they had beencompensating like i said for a smallerweaker sensor to bring it up and bringout all the magicand nowrunning that same type of look starts tomake photos look a bit over processed alittle over hdr-y pretty frequently sothere are a bunch of interesting thingsabout this camera but like i said 50megapixels doing 4-1 binning with nooption to keep all 50 means you're onlyreally getting a small amount ofimproved sharpness over the previous butphotos are sharp white balance is prettygood but still bias is a little bit toocool sometimes but you can see inregular lighting the pixel does anenormous amount of hdr and it almostlooks like someone turned up the clarityslider in photoshop just a little bittoo high so shadows never quite get allthe way to black and it's very rare thathighlights like the sky are ever blownout but then yeah that also gives you abit of an exaggerated likeover-processed look when the photoshould just have regular lighting nowthe thing is this sensor is amazing soit's taking in a ton of light and a lotof information so actually the moredifficult high dynamic range shootingsituations are handled great likeshooting directly into the sun orshooting at night with bright lightsthese more difficult shots are actuallyvery impressive looking now because theprocessing is keeping so muchinformation in the final shotbut even so these darker scenes tend tooverexpose when you don't adjust theslider in the viewfinder so it's reallyimpressive believe me having all thissharpness and almost no noise in anighttime shotthat's technicallyincredible but it shouldn't look thisbright so here's a comparison shot withthe iphone 13 pro on full auto just togive you an idea of the differencebetween night modes it's almost turningnight into day on the pixel but here's apretty perfect example to visualize allthis processing on the left is a rawshot from the pixels camera that wecolored with just a quick boost to thevibrance and on the right side is agoogle process jpegand that sensor you can see is getting aton of information and detailand the processingis to make it look like what it thinkswe want on a phone screen again bringingup the shadows bringing down thehighlights sharpening everythingbut i think the ideal might be somewherein between these now the ultrawide ispretty good it's not amazing but it hasa lot of the same traits as last yearand i'm glad they're still in ultra widethere's no macro mode with it though andthen the telephoto on the pro wassurprisingly good when you're movingaround handheld although you still getmuch better sharpness out of like an s21ultra google super resume is pretty goodat sharpening up and improving shotsthat would normally be soft but they canstill tend to look a little bit like awatercolor painting at the extremes butoverall you know as someone who's lovedthe pixel's rich contrast look andreally honestly preferred it for yearsover pretty much anything elsei think this is an almost great camerathat can take some tweaks and and maybesome software updates at least i'mhoping to get better because i i'vetaken some incredible sharp photos withthis camera and i've also taken someweird looking ones so basically i guessthe question is would you rather have acamera that's a 10 out of 10sometimes but also a 7 out of 10 someother timesor just a camera that just gives you 9out of 10 9 9 nine every single timebecause that's the iphone that nine outof ten that consistent shot the iphone13 pro's camera system is moreconsistentbut the pixels camera aces some shotssometimes but then also gives mea really weird over hdr looking shotthat i wouldn't even want to share sobounces back and forth i will say thevideo from the pixel did really level upkind of the same style as the photos ithas great dynamic range greatstabilization and that big sensor isgiving you real background blur andimpressively staying in focus most ofthe time and in some of these harderscenes you can definitely see theprocessing working like here when it'strying to bring up the shadows it'spretty noisy but still overall color andexposure and white balance and thedetails are all great with the pixel 6'svideo and i'm really happy to see thatand then another thing i noticed thepixel really cranks iso all the way upin the viewfinder so you can see a lotof noise before you snap a photo andstart the processing like it's very easyto see this here in a screen recordingbut that's what it's doing you can seein a selfie viewfinder especially it'lllook super jacked up and really noisyjust to keep a high frame rate andshutter speed when you're taking theselfie and then you take it and you seeit process and then everything sharpensup and it looks miles betterand while that seemed kind of weird tome at first i actually think this is agood move so tensor has a horsepower tojust run the stuff at high iso and thepreview might not look great but atleast it's not choppy and laggy and thenit basically under promises and overdelivers people will see the viewfinderand think this will be a bad photo andthen they'll be shocked at how good thefinal photo is when you're taking photoswith faces in them the ultrawide camerais always running at a higher shutterspeed so if you get someone moving tooquick and the primary camera has ablurry face it can merge in the fastersharper face from the ultrawide camerainto your shot automatically i meanthat'syou kind of just never have blurry facesin your photos overall just as someonewho's used now both of these phones fora couple weeksiphone's camera systemis better than the pixelsit just is right now it doesn't it'smore consistent it doesn't struggle withover processing it shoots to moreformats it's a better overall camerasystem butthis the hardware is so good in thepixels and you can see that promise inthose 10 out of 10 shotsthatthe pixel fan in me is like hoping maybein one or two software updatesit'll be a 10 out of 10 more often butuntil then because we don't know ifthat's ever gonna happenyeah you saw the sample shots that'sthat's what it does that's how it lookssoyeah i want to come back to the price atthe end here like i said 5.99 for pixel68.99 for pixel 6 pro it's a 300 deltaand for that difference you're getting120 hertz over 90 1440p over 1080 acurved screen over a flat onesome glossy sides over the matte sides ilike the matte sides better then you getan extra telephoto camera on the backand you get a wider selfie camera on thefront a little more ram a little bitbigger screenthat's kind of it so basically myconclusion ispixel 6really good phone really really greatdeal because for 600 bucks this is oneof the best ones you can getand then the difference in money to getto six proit makes it a better phone than thepixel six sure a lot of good stuff herebut this stuff doesn't vault it over thetop of all the other flagshipsit just you know i would get this phoneif you've really got to have thetelephoto or the ultra wide selfiecamera or the bigger faster screenthat's kind of the main bullets but ithink pixel 6 is almost incredible andthe truth isthis is the most important google phoneyet this this pivot toyou know from enthusiast phones andreally cool cameras and softwarefeatures to still being the smartestsmartphone in the world but also nowhaving much better hardware this newdesign and making their own chip andcompetinglike really competingi'm into it i'm super into it so that'sfun to seethat's pixel six and six proit's techtober so there's still a lotmore to talk about so stay tuned forthat stuff subscribe if you haven'talready thanks for watchingcatch you guys the next

4oVA67JrSe8,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,so pixel 6 pro six months later let's doit the pixel 6 pro is like many phonesthese days a flipping huge 6.7 inchbrick but a rather lovely brick packingsome splendid tech including google'sfirst tensor chipset and an impressivecamera setup now for the past six monthsi've pretty much permanently had thepixel 6 pro stuffed inside of mybackpack or a random pocket in order todo the likes of camera comparisons andwhile i rather enjoyed it when i firstreviewed it i gotta say i definitelypreferred its wii sibling the originalpixel six but have my feelings towardsthe pixel six pro changed it all overthe past half a year well i recentlyslapped my sim back in there again for afull week used it as my full-time phoneagain and here is my full re-review andfor more on the links to grits techplease do poke subscribe ending thatnotifications bell cheers now despiteits relatively skinny bezels the pixel 6pro is still just as massive as thegalaxy s22 ultra and other godzillasized smartphones not to mention quitechunky and hefty to boot so one-handeduse even with the screen shrinkingfeature is about as much fun as playingchess for the flatulent howler monkeyand you won't want to rest it on theedge of a sofa either because thatslippery r send means that the pixel 6pro will just glide its way straight tothe edge before hurling itself off iknow exactly how you feel buddy thatmighty screen started a scratch up afterjust a few days like many gorilla glassvictor's panels so i've got to say sixmonths on i thought it would be anabsolute state but thankfully a fewextra little very light nicks have beenadded to the collection but that's aboutit and that's despite occasionally beingchucked in a pocket with othersmartphones or literally just bouncingaround inside of my backpack the alloyframe has also been dinked up a littlein places but nothing horrendous thepixel 6 pro still looks rather smartwith a unique design that certainlystands out from rivals while this whitemodel is adept at masking greasy printsand other grime it is just annoying thatthe bits of crap and dust and grimemanage to constantly wedge themselves inthese sharp interior corners above andbelow the camera bump and if you've notgot any long fingernails to dig them outthen you're basically stuck with thembut at least the pixel 6 pro is fullyip68 water and dust resistant so you cangive a good dunking in a sink orwhatever and clean out all that crap theandroid 12 experience has been highlyenjoyable here on the pixel 6 pro evenif the occasional bug does pop up toruin your day like an unexpected mrsbrown's boys repeat and that is amassive shame given how long the pixel 6pro has been around now you'd expectmost of these bugs to be ironed out inthe first month or so really and we'renot talking anything major here exactlyjust annoying little things like forinstance a notification saying thatsomebody is calling you on whatsapp whenin fact you've actually answered theircall and spoken with them and alreadyhung up or sometimes when you go toshoot an impromptu video the pixel won'tbother to pause any audio that happensto be playing at the time so farfor some people these bugs seem to be apretty regular kick of the crotch butfor me i only very occasionally see aproper bit of jank but even minor boutsof bulkiness shouldn't be happening on aflagship smartphone especially a googlebranded smartphone where they've donethe hardware as well as the software andalso i've definitely seen a lot morebugs here on the pro model rather thanthe regular pixel six but i don't knowif that's just dumb luck or whateverit's just been my experience apart fromthese little bugs though android 12 hasbeen an absolute pleasure for one thecall screening feature is an absolutegodsend if you're constantly plaguedwith endless spam calls fromtelemarketing saving me countlessminutes of politely telling them to gofist themselves then of course there'sthe revamped privacy features you cankeep tabs on all of your apps and whatthey're actually up to rather than theother way around plus the improved themeand tools and numerous other uiimprovements make android look and feelslicker than ever before as ever thougha lot of the best bits are actuallythings that you wouldn't really noticebecause you're not really supposed tonotice them i'm talking about unsungheroes like the excellent haptics whichserve up whisper quiet rumblings justwhen you need them and i also appreciatea lot of the fresh new updates such asthe at a glance widget which is gettingbetter with every update you can now getthe likes of a quick snapshot of whoeverjust rang your nest doorbell forinstance you have to waste time draggingdown notifications tapping your way intothe app checking it out by which timewhoever's studying your front door isprobably buggered right off if they'rean impatient courier or whatever pluswhen you go google you can count on fourmore years of security and os updateswhich is much better than most rivalsoffer my only other complaint is aimedsquare at the pixel 6 pro's absolutestinker of a fingerprint sensor whilemost optical sensors these days areactually pretty decent this turdsandwich gives me daily headaches andyes i know it's kind of tedious peoplebanging on about just how bad thisoptical scanner is but seriously i'veregistered my thumbs multiple times justto see if that helps at all and even ifthey're born dry i'm talking not coveredin chicken grease or pork pie residue orany of that shenanigans still thatsensor fails just more than it shouldseriously people who pass me on thestreet must think i'm an absolutementalist screaming at my smartphoneit's me you bastard let me in and rumorshave it that google is going to sortthis out for the pixel 6 here i reallyhope that's the case or at the veryleast we've got some respectable fierceunlock action on there as an alternativeanyway moving on and nothing more readyto add to my original pixel 6 pro reviewas far as the media chops go that oledscreen is a match for any other premiumsmartphone panel out there spaffing outbeautifully crisp quality plus visualswith sharp contrast perfect for drinkingin an hdr movie on the go bright poppycolors are where it really excels withall the other oled benefits includingwide viewing angles well thankfully thedinky selfie orifice doesn't intrude toomuch on the action when you do fullscreen that more for the auto brightnessis still doing its job perfectly whileat 120hz maximum refresh keeps androidlooking silky smooth and besides thelack of a headphone jack as per bloodyusual the pixel 6 pro doesn't disappointwhen it spaffs out sound streaming tobluetooth speakers or headphones is ajudder free experience even when youpush the limits of the supported rangeor you're jostling for space in acrowded post-covered world even thestereo speakers are pretty decent forsmartphone blasters pleasingly loud butnot too tinny you got ufs 3.1 storage ofcourse like pretty much all flagshipseither 128 gigs or 256 gigs if you'vegot a bit more money to spunk it googlebut of course as is standard forflagship smartphones no micro sd memorycard support to expand that when neededaudible psi now performance on the pixel6 pro may not be quite as beefy as manyrivals but every day play it on here issilky smooth helped along by the 12 gigsof ddr5 ram and the fact that you've gotthat lovely stock version of androidwhich just marries up nicely with thetensor chipset i got to say that theback end of that pixel 6 pro can get abit toasty at times even when i'm merelybrowsing the web for you know 40 50minutes at a time with the screen on thewhole time or using it as a sat nav thatreally heats the bugger up thankfully ihaven't noticed any performance issuescaused by the season even when the phonescreen has been on for a solid couple ofhours at a time and if you are gamingwell the likes of gentian impact youwill see the occasional little judderand stumble unfortunately if you doboost up those graphic settings to thehighest possible levels whereas a lot ofrivals do tend to cope with it prettywell especially this flagship sort ofprice point that said the experience isstill perfectly playable and if you dojust bump down the graphic settings everso slightly then you tend to get a muchsmoother frame rate and it is a lot offun and i also appreciate how google hasfinally added a gaming mode to stockandroid which has been a very long timecoming sadly this hasn't really evolvedat all over the past six months despitethe constant android 12 updates it'sstill pretty basic as far as gamingmodes go something compared with thelikes of sony and the stuff you'll findlike some color os and me ui but it isdefinitely better than nothing it hasbeen very useful to just doing littlethings like blocking notifications whenyou're balls deep in a call of dutysession and that tensor platform doesalso add a tasty bit of sub 6 5g actionso perfect here for the uk but we don'thave the super speedy millimeter waveaction just yet you've also got wi-fi 6eaction on there and no complaints oneither of those fronts the mobileconnectivity the wi-fi connectivity beenreliable and nice and nippy now batterylife does seem to have reduced just awee bit over the past few monthsannoyingly but i still have no troublemaking it through a long full day onjust a single charge only one time inrecent memory have i managed to fullydrain the battery in a single day andthat was with about seven hours ofscreen on time pretty full intensive usethe 30 watt wide charging inparticularly nippy it matches mostrivals from like some samsung and sonyfor instance but not quite reaching thedramatic highs of the likes of the realme's and the xiaomi's with their 100watt plus charging speeds you do havewireless charging chucked in here aswell like most of the premium flagshipphones and the most convincing reason tograb a pixel 6 pro of arrivals like thegalaxy s22 plus is the excellent cameratech spearheaded by an impressive 50 megprimary sensor with optical imagestabilization no matter what you'reshooting and no matter what time of dayyou're shooting it the chances are verygood that you'll get lifelike resultsthis thing is fantastic for capturingwide sweeping vistas when you're onholiday especially when you swap to that12 meg ultrawide angle lens or the 48meg telephoto shooter to get a pulledback or close-up view of some nifty bitof architecture and the pixel 6 pro alsodoes a bang-up job with close-upportraits of your pets and people whojust happen to hang around the samehouse as you of course the pixel 6 andpixel 6 pro have some stiff competitionthese days from the likes of the vivox80 pro and the oppo find x5 pro andjust the regular oppo find x5 as well infact those oppo blogs are actually a weebit better than the pixel in low lightespecially when it comes to shootingvideo in low light i did still find withthe pixel that your subject will have tostay pretty still otherwise they willcome out blurry and for video you canshoot 4k resolution footage with thesame impressive color accuracy crispaudio capture and the option of swappingbetween the three main lenses as yourecord with transitions that aren'thorrifically distracting as i mentionedi think the 5x5 phones perform better inmore ambient conditions and samsung's sseries handsets produce video that lookand sound a little cleaner but thisblower does a decent job for your homemovies and then up front you've got an11.1 megapixel selfie snapper which hasa slightly wider viewing angle than theregular pixel 6 but serves up verysimilar picks and this is one of themore disappointing aspects of the pixelcamera tech because in dimmer light youwill get very grainy flat looking picksat least it would be disappointing ifactually bothered to take selfies forany reason other than these reviews nonoteworthy new camera features have beenbunged on the pixel 6 pro in the sixmonths since it launched cause thatmagic eraser tool is still a bit of astunner as long as you don't expect toomuch from it but you know you've got allthe basic stuff in there the portraitmode works the charm and everything soit is overall a very satisfying snapperif not quite one of the best aroundanymore but for more on all that jazzyou can

aLlhcFqrRzA,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,this is the google pixel 6 pro and it'sthe pixel that's been long overdue itfinally sees a much larger 120 hertzscreen beefed up camera hardware andandroid 12 out of the box google saysits new smartphone is the bestexpression of android and we're here toput that to the test i'm ricky for gsmmarina and this is our review of thegoogle pixel 6 prowith the phone's 6.7 inch display andweighing in at 210 grams the pixel 6 prois beefythe phone shows off a new designlanguage for google pixel with itsbolder corners and lines but with curvyglass around the

there it isthe frame is made of polished aluminumall the way around except the top partwhich has a plastic insert for lettingmillimeter wave 5g signals pass throughi really enjoy the pixel 6 pro's newdesign it's a new direction for googlebut i'm not a fan of these new plasticcasesthey seem to let dust pass through tooeasily and i already found some debrismarks on the frame so i would skip

HzieL6ZSOXw,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,now if you saw my original review you'llknow i'm a big fan of google's fresh newpixel 6 flagship smartphone which maynot be the best smartphone around whenit comes to sheer grunt but it'scertainly one of the most satisfyingpocket-friendly experiences around atleast that doesn't involve self-abuseand or possible jail time but if youwant near demand the ultimate pixelexperience you will have to stump up acouple hundred quid more for this herepro model it's bigger it's better insome ways at least and it's still gotthat wide boy camera bump and itdefinitely still makes my pp tingle withdelight i've been testing the pixel 6pro for a full month now i've actuallymy sim slapped in there full time forthe last couple of weeks i've beengiving it a really thorough going overso here is my full in-depth pixel 6 proreview and for more the latest andgreatest set please do poke subscribeand hitting that notifications bellcheers now as a bit of a short ass withteeny weeny hamster hands i'm moreattracted to smaller phones like theoriginal pixel 6 rather than 6.7 inchbeasts like this here pixel 6 pro thisfull-on heifer may have skinnier bezelsthan its sibling and not actually weirdmuch more to boost either but it isstill a proper two-hander that saidhaven't also recently used the obsceneshiny house brick that is the iphone 13pro max well suddenly the pixel 6 prodoesn't seem quite so ridiculous besidesobviously being bigger than the pixel 6the pro model also sports a polishedalloy frame and boosts the durabilitywith some shatter resistant gorillaglass victors slathered across the backend and what a back end it is as wellcertainly the kind that lingers a longtime in the memory with that uniquecamera bump which isn't so much of abump more of a watch still i do likegoogle's design which is attractivelysymmetrical and suitably shiny you willfind that even a light bit of fondlingdoes quickly caught to the back of thepixel 6 pro in all kinds of smudgygrease but thankfully this bright whitefinish does a pretty good job of maskingall of that greasy crud otherwise youcan also grab the pixel 6 pro in stormyblack or sorta sunny which is anotherkind of bright happy effort which makesme kind of puke in my mouth a bit everytime i see it sort ofsunny after a month of serious testing igrilled a glass victor's corten on theback is still free of scuffs but thedisplay has been scarred with some lightscratching so i would highly recommendslapping some form of screen protectoron that thing to protect your premiumvery expensiveshiny new toy the good news is no sweatwhatsoever if you do i want to rock thepixel 6 pro by the pool or you know in abathtub something i like that becauseit's fully ip68 water and dust resistantnow if you have already seen my pixel 6review you'll already know i'm a bit ofa fan of android 12. on the moist pantsscale we're talking full-on tropicalshowers here the new theme and tools andthose aesthetical tweaks help to freshenup the ui while the new privacy andsecurity features offer a proper bit ofpeace of mind and then there's the toolsthat google finally got around tochucking in like a dedicated gamingdashboard and a proper one-handed modehip-hip huzzah here on the pixel 6 proyou've basically got the exact samesoftware experience as on the originalpixel 6. so if you want to in-depth lookat some of those great new features thenew ui and everything definitely gocheck out my full pixel 6 and pixel 6pro tips and tricks guide which is liveright now that covers all the stuff iwas just banging on about and morebesides and as you might expect from adedicated google blower you get plentyof dedicated software support as well upto five years at least guaranteed so ifyou're in it for the long haul noworries there now one issue that i hadwith the original pixel 6 was the lessthan fantastic optical fingerprintsensor which is one of the weakest thati've used in recent times and sadly it'sthe same ball lake here on the pro modelas well frankly it is very uncooperativesometimes it takes a couple of porks torecognize you even when your pans areperfectly clean and dry and if they aremoist or grubby then frankly good luck of course that wouldn't bequite so much of an issue if we actuallyhad fierce unlock support here on thepixel but once again android does notsupport that shiz not one bit so muchlike on apple's iphones i found myselfinserting my pin more often than i wouldhope to ever do on a modern smartphoneon the storage front as well anotherminor grumble there the fact you've gotno micro sd memory card support toexpand that storage but at least you doget 128 gig minimum otherwise you candouble that to 256 if you're liking itis of course ufs 3.1 so nice and nippyespecially good when you're loadingmassive games like gentian impact stufflike that now one of the benefits ofgrabbing this here pro model over thestandard pixel 6 is that bigger sharperscreen it is a 6.7 inch oled displaythat will have your peepers cream in ifpeepers are actually capable of creamingthat is and that's actually quite ahorrible image so moving on thanks tothe supremely crisp quad hd plusresolution and bright punchy coloroutput hdr streaming is supportedconjuring up stunning natural visualsotherwise anime fans should definitelybe satisfied with that lush output asfor the brightness levels while theythankfully skill all the way from superdim for comfortable late night viewingall the way up to oh wow my retinas areactually on fire supremely bright outputfor when you're battling against reallystrong external light and likewise therefresh rate also has a much strongerrange compared with the original pixel 6as well drop it as low as 10 hertz whenabsolutely now it is happening on screento preserve power and boost it all theway up to 120 hertz for your supportedcontent and that besides the size andthe resolution of the display is themain benefit of grabbing the pro overthe standard pixel 6. i'm also a fan ofthe pixel 6 pro stereo speakers whichpack a perfectly respectable punch thataudio does not distort on higher volumesand on the high volume it is powerfulenough to cut through plenty ofbackground while the bluetooth5.2 chops are also perfect for wirelessstreaming i didn't experience any kindof judders or shaky connectionshenanigans even when i was planting myway through merry old london town atkicking out time it's just a damn shamethat once again there's absolutelysubtle headphone jack action on herejust like with most of the priceyflagship smartphones it's just reallyirritating that nobody else is followingin sony's footsteps and bringing backthat 3.5 mil jack now performance on thepixel 6 pro admit they may not be quiteas beefy as on some rivals like thesamsung galaxy s21 ultra for instancebut i did find that every deer playerwas supremely smooth here on the googlepixel 6 pro helped along admirably bythe 12 gigs of ddr5 ram that tensorchipset had all of my apps runningperfectly even when i was nippingbetween quite a few in quick successionwhile gaming is a more pleasurableexperience here versus the standardpixel 6. while the dinkier blower tendedto heat up under gentian impact-relatedduress this pro can handle bonkers animeshenanigans with a metaphorical springin its step and yeah you've even got agaming dashboard now so you can blocknotifications capture your finest onlinemoments and yes it is quite a basicgaming mode compared with a lot ofrivals just look at what sony's doing onits xperia flagships for instance thesheer volume of features that thingmanages to pack in uh considering it's afresh new gaming feature as welldefinitely very impressive indeed buthere's hoping that that will getupgraded with all kinds of great newtools really really soon and of coursethe tensor chipset also packs in supportfor sub six 5g here in the uk as well soyou've got strong connectivity thereyou've also got a tasty bit of wi-fi 6eaction and of course an industry-leadingsecurity partition for safely encryptingand storing your most private privatesand this pro model even packs into theball for ultra wide bands at comstec aswell something not found in the originalpixel six so you got full support forthat precision tracking fishes like tilenow let's talk battery life which on thepixel 6 series has proven strangelycontroversial when it really shouldn'thave after my original pixel 6 review asi absolutely adored the battery life andi still do i had a few comments sayingoh that's really really strange becausewe've heard the battery life isabsolutely crud and i did a bit ofdigging it appears that one prominent uhus-based youtuber has more that thebattery life was a bit crap on the pixelsix i was really confused by thisbecause i'd had the exact oppositeexperience so i spoke with all of my uktech nerds journal family who were justas confused as me because they'd had thesame experience they thought the batterylife was brilliant and i obviously can'tcomment on this other guy's experienceswith the pixel 6 or the pixel 6 pro alli can say is that here on the pixel 6pro i found the battery life wasfantastic even at the longest mostarduous days i would have the screen onfor about seven or eight hours i'd useit as a sat nav for an hour or two i'vehad plenty of play with that camerashooting photos and video as well a goodbit of gaming on the side some videostreaming lots of music and podcaststreaming in the background as well bythe time i finally crumbled up onto mymattress travelled up under my duvet istill had generally have like 15 to 20battery life left on this thing and ifyou took it easy you could probably gettwo full days out of a single charge ifyou do want to moan about something youcan moan about the fact that you don'tactually get an adapter bundled in thebox and it tops off at 30 watts whichisn't particularly nippy compared with alot of uh even quite budgety uhsmartphones these days although you doat least have support for wirelesscharging if you have another qi pad orstand knocking about the place you'vegot reverse wireless charging you'vealso got adaptive charging as well whichseems to work very nicely indeed here onthe pixel 6 pro basically learns yourcharging habits and make sure it justtrickle charges up until the point whereyou normally spring out a bed thatshould hopefully help to preventlong-term damage of course the pixelfeature that's been getting the mostattention outside of that battery is thecamera tech and here on the pro you getthe same 50 megapixel primary camerasensor as the pixel 6 complete withoptical image stabilization and it isonce again a proper cracker especiallyif you take a lot of shots of familyfriends and other things with faces skintones and other hues are accuratelycaptured in pretty much any conditionsindoors or out while the portrait modeagain does a solid job nine times out often when things do get dim however thepixel 6 pro can struggle with motion andwhile the 12 megapixel ultrawide angleshooter works well in good light thistoo starts to stumble when conditionsget dark for video you can shoot 4kresolution footage with the sameimpressive color accuracy as well ascrisp audio capture and the option ofswapping between those three main lensesas you record that's right outside threelenses because you've got a third lenshere on the pixel 6 pro which is the bigcamera upgrade versus the standard pixelsix and this is a 48 megapixel telephotosnapper which serves up a four timesoptical zoom or 20 times maximum zoomwith digital cropping and while thepixel 6 pro is no s21 ultra in thisregard this lens is ideal for gettingcloser to kids and cats at play withoutactually disturbing them returning finelooking picks up to around the 10 timeszoom mark up front on the pixel 6 proyou have an 11.1 megapixel selfiesnapper which boasts a slightly widerviewing angle than the original pixel 6but it does serve up very similar picksas long as the lighting is decent yourselfies will be fine but in softer lightyou'll get a lot of green and the proreally starts to properly struggle andwhile you can shoot up to 4k resolutionfootage here on the pixel 6 pull with aslightly more zoomed in uh affair if ifyou like let's let's definitely never dothat again i thought the footage wasreally fine again if you're trying toshoot indoors it'll be a bit grainy andnot particularlyaccurate colors or any of that stuff i ido vaguely look this pill but it's notquite 100 right and the pixels are asusual quite light on bonus camerafeatures but the magic eraser tool doesa great job of wiping out any fellowhumans and other background clutter toclean up your picks definitely wellworth checking out however i would juststay clear of the freshly motion modewhich frankly is just a bit of a bulkygimmicky thing that more often than notjust doesn't really work very wellanyhow that's a brief summary of thepixel 6 pro's camera tech but if youwant a more in-depth look at thehardware and the software as well anddefinitely go check out my full pixel 6pro camera review i've also compared itside by side with the original pixel 6to see what the difference is and thatthere's my full final frank review ofthe google pixel 6 prof i've been usingit for a full month actually had my simin there for a couple of weeks as myfull-time smartphone i've got to say ireally enjoyed using it gone with itvery well indeed it's certainlyexpensive it's very pricey in deeds butit is a solid all-around experiencethere are very few flaws to speak ofhere certainly compared with the the newiphones that's for damn show outside ofthe usual grumbles like you know noheadphone jack no expandable storageyadda yadda if you are still undecidedwhether you should get the pixel 6 proor just the standard pixel 6 well i'vedone a full side-by-side comparison withthem both as well to show you exactlyhow they stack up against one anotherbut i'd say long story short like if youwant that more flexible camera tech ifyou're going to be doing a lot of gamingand if you prefer your handsets to beabsolutely friggin whopping huge thenthe pixel 6 pro is a worthy upgradeotherwise to be perfectly honest i'd bevery happy just with the standard pixel6 which is a bit more compact which iswhat i prefer and it's a hell of a lotcheaper as well so have you been uhrocking the pixel 6 pro in your pantsslash bag be great to hear from you downin the comments below and please do

XdXYs_U7xHk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are Google’s latest  phones in the Pixel lineup that I’ve been  using for over 6 months now and these are without  a doubt the best phones Google has ever made,  but what are the top features that make them  stand out, should you go for one now or wait  for the 7 and 7 Pro later this year, is the  Pro really worth the price over the regular 6,  and why would you go with a  Pixel over a Samsung device?I'm going to answer all of those  questions and more. And first,  let's talk about how Google implemented  Android 12 on these Pixels because it makes  these phones feel very different from  any other phone. I've used previously,  Google did a great job making the Pixel 6 and 6  Pro’s software feel very fun and differentiated  from past Android devices. And I love how easy it  is to match the system’s colors to your wallpaper  with the new Material You theming and you can  make it all match your phone’s hardware color.The colors you choose run deep into  the OS, showing up in quick settings,  regular settings and in other UI areas like  widgets and even app icons. Unfortunately,  it seems like only Google’s own widgets and maybe  one or two from apps I have have embraced the new  material U styling, and the same goes for app  icons, you’ll only see the new icon theming  feature really work with Google’s own Android  apps. So, the widget experience, it's still a  little bit inconsistent compared to what you  get on iOS in terms of visual consistency.However, I do like that Android actually gives  widgets more functionality. like for example  the Pocketcast widget, I can just tap play to  resume the podcast I was listening to whereas on  iOS if you tap the same Pocketcast widget but it  takes you into the app and then you can hit play. Now there are of course Pixel-specific features  that you can get on the 6 and 6 Pro that you  cannot get on any other Android device. And these  features help set the Pixel apart from its main  competition from Samsung.Some of these features  are small things like the Now Playing feature that  shows what music is playing in the background,  others are bigger like hold for me, which I’ve  used so much when calling a customer service  number. When you’re waiting for a person to  pick up on the other end, the Pixel will wait on  hold for you and will notify you when a customer  service rep picks up so you don’t have to listen  to that awful hold music for 20+ min and can focus  on other things. You also get call screening  as well with the Pixel where the Assistant  will screen incoming calls from unknown numbers,  allowing you to see the conversation the person  had with the Google Assistant before you decide to  pick up, making a likely spam call very obvious.Next up, also new to the Pixel with this version  of Android is security hub, which I think is  a really well designed upgrade that makes it  easy to check and see if any of your accounts,  passwords, or device settings need your  attention so your security is always protected.Android 12 also includes one of  my personal favorite features,  which is the work profile, which allows  me to separate my work Google Workplace  apps from my personal apps, and it makes it  easy to schedule my work apps to turn off at  a specific time at night, and also has a nice  button that allows you to turn them on and off.Now if I missed out on your favorite Pixel or  Android features, let me know in the comments  what feature keeps you coming back to Android  and/or the Pixel. And to see more content around  Pixel related features and more videos on Google  products, make sure you subscribe to the channel.Next let's talk about performance  and both the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6  Pro include Google's first ever custom design  chip, which is called the Google Tensor chip,  and over the past six months, the performance on  both of these phones has just been blazing fast,  especially when this chip is paired with  the 6 Pro’s 120 hz display. The tensor chip  helps enable some new features this year, like the  Pixel’s improved video and still image processing,  and yes, like in past years, the camera  quality on this year’s pixels is superb  and even the video quality is pretty good,  which has not been the case in past years.The camera experience on the Pixels aside from  the great Pixel launcher experience, that’s been  the feature that keeps me coming back time and  time again. While I’ll admit the differences  between phone cameras seems to have been getting  smaller among the flagship phones from Google,  Apple, and Samsung, the Pixel’s camera still  stands out to me in a few ways. One, the 6 Pro  has the best telephoto lens I’ve used on a phone  thus far and captures some truly excellent shots.The second major benefit of this camera system  is facial color and tone. Google did a lot of  work with their camera’s algorithms this year  with Real Tone to make sure they captured  darker skin complexions much better, which  others have reported seems to be the case  I've actually even noticed that this Pixel camera  system does better than any other phone I've used  previously at capturing my own skin tones,  especially in difficult lighting situations.  Like when you've got hard sunlight hitting your  skin, the color, accuracy, and tone of my skin  tone in these photos is just better than any  other camera system I've used, including the  iPhone 13 Pro’s. Overall, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro  are very comparable to the other main phone I use,  my iPhone 13 Pro and I find I prefer the Pixel’s  look about half the time compared to my iPhone’s.  It still gets you those hallmark, high contrast  and cool Pixel shots which I really dig.New this year on the Pixel is much improved  video processing which makes the videos you  take useable and makes the videos I’ve taken on  previous pixels look pretty much like garbage,  especially if they were in low light  scenarios. Now, the video quality  isn't as good as the iPhones which just produces  way less noisy of an image and overall is just  solid, but the Pixel’s video quality isn't far  behind anymore and something I definitely use.Now one other new camera feature that Google added  this year for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is called  Magic Eraser,which makes it very easy to go into  a photo you take and delete people and objects  out. I’ve used this a good bit compared to some of  the other new features like face unblur and motion  mode which are also new on these pixels. Magic  eraser work pretty well as long as you know it’s  limitations. I use it to take out hairfly, and  other unwanted objects and one piece of advice,  you’re going to get better results if you  use pinch to zoom and then make your edits.And the best part is, you can use this feature  on not only photos you take on your pixel,  but on photos sent to you or in photos that you  previously took in your Google Photos library.Now the next thing I've really enjoyed with  both of these phones is Google beach dictation  feature. It's one of the best new features  on these phones thanks to Google's Tensor  chip. These pixels have a brand new speech  recognition model that will automatically add  the right punctuation and for the first time, it’s  phonetically based, instead of keystroke based,  and in my experience this makes the smart  suggestions much better and more useful.  In fact, Google’s speech recognition model  is so good, I’ve been using it to generate  all of the closed captions for the videos on this  channel for the past month with a few light edits.The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro also feature a completely  new and somewhat polarizing external design,  and after six months for the pro-specifically,  Google just created a great phone to comfortably,  hold in your hand. The metal rails and rounded  edges make it more grippy than you’d expect and  given the phone’s large size, it actually  weighs about 20g less than the Samsung S22  Ultra. The 6 is also comfortable to hold  but I’ve found its brushed aluminum sides  make it slightly more slick and because  it’s about the same weight as the Pro,  but in a smaller form factor,  it feels a bit more weighty.Next let's talk battery life.  Both of these phones have about  average battery life for me. Easily, lasting  me all day with light to moderate phone use.  I use the Pro more than the 6 and  the Pro typically will get down  to around 40% battery after a full day of  use by the time I want to charge it at night.The last hardware feature I've really enjoyed with  these phones are haptics and specifically for the  pro because the haptic engine is actually located  a little bit farther down the phone's body,  you really feel the haptics when you're typing  on the keyboard and they feel great. These are  definitely the best haptics I've ever felt  on a pixel and the regular 6’s are good too.The last thing I've enjoyed with these phones  are the Android ecosystem benefits. You can  download apps outside of the playstore like  fortnite and really tinker and customize  with the device if you want to vs. something  like iOS, which is more locked down. However,  now this leads me to my first downside that I  found with these Pixels and that's their overall  accessory ecosystem. Samsung and Apple are  the two dominant players in smartphones today  and they have a ton of accessories and other  devices you can buy that’ll work seamlessly  with your their phones. Google just doesn’t  have that yet, though recent leaks suggest  they're close to launching a new smartwatch which  we’ll of course review on the channel, So make  sure you're subscribed to see that video, and I do  think that having a smartwatch made by Google will  make the Pixel’s accessory ecosystem a bit more  competitive compared to Samsung and Apple's and  related to accessories, I think Google needs to  make better cases for the pixel. This year’s were  a bit of a disappointment, they’re OK, not great  and make me miss the great fabric cases Google  made for previous Pixels. The fingerprint sensor,  which is a bit slower than other phones I've used,  but has worked fine over the past six months, but  it still makes me miss in face unlock in a Pixel.  FaceID and Face Unlock are the fastest ways to  unlock a phone in my experience and something  I’d like to see Google bring back. Now, the biggest downside I found with  both of these devices over the past  six months has been Auto Brightness.  It just isn't good. It’s not nearly as accurate  as my Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro.  Its too quick to get to a different brightness  level vs. other phones that do a better job  fading in and out brightness so you notice the  adjustments less. And sometimes the adjustments it  makes are just so wrong, especially in low light  situations. I just turn the feature off entirely.The last downside I found with these devices  is only for the Pixel 6 and that's its screen  For $600, I just expect a better screen  at this point. While it is an OLED screen,  the viewing angle shifts which have a green  and purple color to them with this display  just make it look cheap and not great compared to  other phones and devices at this price range. It's  a screen I'd expect to see on a Pixel A-series  line of phone but not for the Pixel 6. Now,  one other thing I do want to mention a lot has  been made about the Google software updates  over the past six months, and introducing new  bugs and issues with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.I have not personally seen that, which is why I  did not put the software updates in my downsides  part of this video. The only nasty bug I ran into  was the wifi bug where no matter what you did,  the phones would not connect to Wifi, but  that was fixed in a later software update.So those are the downsides I found with these  devices. Now let's talk which Pixel I think  you should get, which one to go for, and  if I recommend both of these devices.  And while I do think the screen is subpar on  the Pixel 6 for the $600 price, the $300 price  difference between the Pixel 6 and the 6 Pro, I do  think that is a bit steep. however, if you do want  a much better screen, telephoto camera, a better  selfie camera and more premium build materials,  like I do, then the pro is really your only option  and it's the phone I typically recommend to people  when they ask me which Pixel they should buy.  Based on my experience, I recommend the Pixel  6 Pro because of its better screen quality. Now  because these phones are over 6 Months old now,  naturally the question is should you wait for the  Pixel 7 and 7 Pro to come out in the fall or get  one of these phones now. It's unlikely Google is  going to do a fundamental redesign with the 7 and  7 Pro. Given the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were such a  huge jump from previous generations of Pixels.My advice would be if you can  find a good deal on the 6 Pro,  I'd go for it. But if you're looking at the  Pixel 6, I'd actually wait at this point. I'd  wait to see what Google does with the Pixel 7  and if they put a better screen in that phone.Now if you don't care about  screen quality of course. Yeah.  You're good to go with the Pixel 6 now.The Google Pixel 6 Pro retails for $899  US dollars and The Pixel 6 retails for  $599 US dollars and you can use the  purchase links here in this video  and in the description below if you’d  like to purchase them or learn more.And if you have any further questions  about either the Pixel 6 or the 6 Pro,  let me know in the comments below and I'll try to  address them there.
