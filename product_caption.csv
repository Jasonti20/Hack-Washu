kGyZn-kOgF8,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,foreign[Music]14 pro Max[Music]I've been using the iPhone 14 pro Maxfor a week now and I've been reallytrying to think of how I can explainthis year's iPhone in one sense and Ithink I finally got it down the 14 proMax is the flagship iPhone model thatwas chosen by Apple to deliver all ofthe super late features that people havebeen begging for for years and let metell you right now Apple nailed it andnot only that but they've masterfullyrefined every bit of the iPhone intotheir Masterpiece with all of theaspects of the iPhone like the designthe display the performance the softwarethe battery life and of course thecameras finally being refined into whatApple has been imagining for years sothe question I'm gonna try to answer inthis review is whether Apple's masteringof features and this iPhone is worthupgrading to despite speculation thatnext year's iPhone 15 Pro will get USBCamong other features in my answer mightjust surprise youforeign[Music]time with fancy music and b-roll let'sget right down to business and talkabout the notch which people have wantedApple to get rid of ever since theiPhone 10 and they finally delivered orhave they Apple's Dynamic Island tookthe Internet by storm when theysurprised everyone with it at theirApple event even convincing some peopleto upgrade for that feature alone but itseems like the sentiment has shifted abit once users actually started using itsome people are complaining that you cansee the individual cutouts when it's indirect sunlight and in my honest opinionI don't think this matters or negativelyimpacts the experience at all others arecomplaining that it's not as useful oractive as Apple made it look in theirmarketing well duh it's marketing and ofcourse with regular use the dynamicIsland won't be used all the time buteven after only one week I've alreadyfound that it makes using my iPhone moreconvenient first off I love how fluidand smooth the animation are like whenface ID authenticates and for the firsttime ever I can see timers counting downat all times the dynamic Island alsofixed the number one thing that I hatedon my iPhone the low batterynotification that used to fill up yourentire display now simply pops up in theisland not only that but I've actuallynoticed myself using it for Apple musicallowing me to jump straight into themusic app by tapping the island insteadof having to go through my app switcherto find it and of course you can tap andhold to bring up the pop-up however Iwish Apple switched the controls to thisone tap brings up the pop-up and asecond tab opens the app no more tap andhold please but what a lot of people aremisunderstanding about the island isthat it's a brand new feature and it'sgonna take a few months before we reallystart seeing it become incredibly usefulas more third-party developers addsupport for things like live activitiesfor sports games in the latest IOS 16beta or even the cool little Tamagotchifeature for the Reddit app Apollo so mypoint of view is that Apple didabsolutely solid work on the Island'sHardware itself finally deleting theNotch and replacing it with somethingthat feels fresh fluid actually usefuland ready for developers to take on sojust give it some time but what reallyimpressed me was that Apple not onlyredesigned the speaker Grille to bethree times thinner but they've greatlyimproved the speakers All Around JustHear It for yourself[Music]not only are the speakers much louderthan before but the quality got betterin every aspect including the bass midsand the highs where they're now moresoft and clear and even better thedynamic range of frequencies is nowwider so you can make out differentinstruments or Tunes where you couldn'tbefore so this is a big deal for me nowmoving on I've got to cover the numberone thing that people will notice rightaway and that's the always-on displayafter so many years of this featurebeing missing Apple has finally added itbut unfortunately a lot of people arecomplaining about it being too bright sobright that they keep thinking thedisplay is on when it's not and to thatmy reply is that they're simply just notused to it give it a week or two you andit'll feel like second nature andhonestly this is the first always ondisplay I've ever seen that stillretains your wallpaper in the backgroundinstead of being completely black soit's totally unique to Apple but thedownside with that is that people arenoticing worse battery life with this onand in my personal use I haven't reallynoticed a huge drop in battery lifeprobably because I don't like using theauto brightness setting which is theonly way to experience the new 2000 nitsof brightness Outdoors but in realityApple should probably just give us theoption to dim down the always on displaybrightness to help save battery lifeinstead of being forced to completelyturn it off but as far as the always-ondisplay itself I absolutely love itsince I no longer forget aboutnotifications that popped up for acouple of seconds before the displayshuts off like what happened previouslynow they are always there so I can'tmiss them the only problem with it rightnow is that you have to tap on thedisplay once before you can tap into anotification I really just wish Applewould make it so you could tap thenotification straight from the always ondisplay and it'll authenticate with baseID open it up and go straight into thatapp so I hope Apple changes that but onthe plus side Apple has made unlockingyour iPhone more convenient than everbefore by adding swipe to wake so allyou have to do is swipe out from thebottom to instantly authenticate withface ID and unlock the phone which is amajor game changer for ease of use nowmoving on to the performance not thatmuch has changed in terms of the rawpower of the a16 bionic chip so nobodyshould be upgrading for that but thereare some major upgrade worthy changesthis year like the new Snapdragon x65modem which is not only quite a bitfaster than the previous x60 but it alsoruns cooler which leads to less heatwhich is the other major change for thelast couple of years display dimming hasbeen a very annoying issue on the proiPhones and this year Apple has finallyimproved the cooling performance byadding this new thermal tape which helpsspread some of the heat away from thechip faster than before which you canvisually see in this thermal cameracomparison and because of that displaydimming has been significantly improvedthis year now it's not completely gonelike when stress testing the graphicsbut it's much better than it was beforestaying at a consistently higherbrightness level when dimmed down soit's not instantly noticeable andannoying like before now before I showyou how this

Max Tech20. now getting back into gaming I waseven able to play Call of Duty mobile at100 brightness with no dimmingwhatsoever which was honestly shockingsince the iPhone 13 Pro Max would dimdown in less than a minute in thisscenario so this change makes the Iphoneexperience so much better and now beforeI get into some of the downsides becauseyes there are downsides we've got totalk about the cameras now on thesurface it seems like not that much haschanged with the main camera even thoughit's the biggest jump in megapixels andsensor size we've ever had in an iPhoneand that's because for some reason thenew 48 megapixel camera still defaultsto shooting 12 megapixel photos bycombining or bidding 4 pixels into oneand because of that you can't really seea big difference between the 14 pro and13 Pro's main cameras at least in thedaytime now in the night time you canclearly see that the 14 pro is betterbecause the larger sensor helps itgather more light and you can easily saythe same thing for all of the othercameras the ultra wide the telephoto theselfie camera all of them have beenimproved in terms of low light and nightmode photos which by itself couldconvince some people to upgrade and bythe way each of those other cameras haveno noticeable improvements in thedaytime as well especially the ultrawide and selfie cameras which now lookvery sharp and because of those changesthe 14 pro has now leapfrogged over theSamsung Galaxy s22 Ultra and z-fold 4 interms of camera quality like we showedyou in our unbiased camera comparisonwhereas the 13 Pro got killed by the twojust last month and part of the reasonwhy the 14 pro is now so good is ofcourse the new 48 megapixel Pro Rockcamera mode which not only shoots atfull 48 megapixel resolution but alsowith 16 bit colors and Apple's Autoprocessing which is great now while somepeople have shown absolutelymind-blowing 48 megapixel Pro raw editsonline we kept things simple bycomparing a couple of photos like thisone which clearly shows the iPhone's 48megapixel sensor beating out Samsung's50 and 108 megapixel sensors on theirmore expensive Flagship phones andcomparing it to the 13 Pro Max there wasa massive difference with the new levelof detail being easily noticeable evenon a smartphone display and some peoplegot creative online showing off someabsolutely stunning photos includingthis one on the macramers forums showingoff the Milky Way with a user beingblown away by the maximum ISO of 12768 saying that these iPhone photosfinally look like a DSLR image howeverthere are a couple of problems first ofall apple is forcing you to shoot in Proraw in order to take 48 megapixel photosand those photos take a lot of storageon average between 50 and 75 megabytesand unfortunately Apple doesn't allowyou to shoot 48 megapixel photos usingmore compressed formats like heic orjpeg you can't even convert them on youriPhone itself so it's really unfortunatethat Apple did this and making thingsworse the 14 pro still has the samelightning Port as before which meansthat it still only supports USB 2.0transfer speeds but since I prefer usingairdrop for transferring photos Idecided to test out how long it'll taketo airdrop 20 Pro Raw photos to my Macand with airdrop it took 36 seconds fromstart to finish which honestly isn'tthat bad and wouldn't ruin my day evenif it was a hundred of these Pro Rawphotos taking three minutes to transferI'd rather do that than grab a cableanyway the bigger problem is when youwant to back up your entire iPhone to aMac and it takes hours and hours on endthat's where lightning 2.0 is terribleand USBC would have solved thisinstantly so hopefully Apple gives thatto us next year or maybe evenThunderbolt but as far as the 48megapixel sensor it's really unfortunatethat we're forced to use prores and evenworse there's no 8K video recordingwhich would be totally doable on thissensor but Apple sadly chose to leave itout this year for whatever reason buteither way Apple still easily defeatsevery other smartphone brand in terms ofvideo recording like the new action modethat's not only more smooth and sharperthan Samsung's steady cam but it alsocrops in way less making it far superioras well as Apple's cinematic mode thatnow supports 4K resolution making itabsolutely destroy the other two Samsungflat ships so personally I finally thinkthat I'm going to start using cinematicmode for regular use whenever I have asubject to record so for the cameras I'mpleasantly surprised with all aspectsexcept for Apple's portrait cutouts thatstill have some issues and the dynamicrange not being as great as some of thecompetitors especially for the ultrawide camera now with all that said I'vegot to add in some of the downsidesApple forced our hand in terms ofremoving this SIM card slot just so theycould move the industry forward which iscool and all but it makes it moredifficult for us buyers to travel on topof that we still don't have Wi-Fi 6E onthe 14 pro which is kind of ridiculousin 2022 and to think that I was about tosplurge on a Wi-Fi 6E router at homebecause of the leaks and rumors and I'malso a bit disappointed that the displaybezels didn't really get that muchthinner and of course it really ticks meoff that Apple didn't add 8K videorecording When the 48 megapixel sensoreasily supports it but other than that Ithink the iPhone camera system is themost refined it's ever been as well astheir display quality which hasseemingly hit Peak refinement along withthe Best in Class always on display modethe fastest chip available in anysmartphone with minimal dimming thistime the most refined Notch that'sactually useful and speaker equalitythat is so good I'm shocked that it'scoming from a smartphone so that makesthis the most refined iPhone ever theonly question is should you actuallyupgrade to it or wait just one more yearfor the 15 Pro which will likely getUSBC and a five times zoom camera wellto be completely honest if you'reupgrading from an iPhone 11 Pro or olderyou're gonna experience a massivedifference from the display quality andthe cameras to the top tier Max savecharging system and cellular performanceand even if you're upgrading from the 12Pro I'd argue that there are still somebig improvements you'll noticeparticularly in terms of fixing thedisplay dimming issues the cameras andthe battery life and yes I know thatUSBC is going to be a nice upgrade butI've realized that I almost exclusivelycharge using macsafe and my MacBook Proat home now uses Max safe as well so Iwouldn't be able to use one USBC cableto charge both of them anyway so in mycase USBC won't really change that muchand yes I'm excited for the five timestelephoto camera which is currently inthe rumor cycle but I rarely take farrange telephoto Zoom photos anyway so Icould live without it and if you canagree with me on that and you have anolder iPhone then I'd say that this yearis finally the perfect year to upgradebecause the new Dynamic Island and thealways on display are fresh differencesyou'll experience daily as well as thefact that I'm a little bit biasedtowards the new space black color whichI've been asking for for years now butwith that said hopefully you enjoyedthis one week review of the 14 pro Maxand if you did go ahead and click thecircle above to subscribe for

Qf1nfq_FW5Q,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,Hello everyone it's SpawnPoiint and I've  been using the iPhone 14 pro Max for nearly  a month now and today I wanted to give you my  updated thoughts on it a Hands-On review of the  features pros and cons so we've obviously got  a few new features such as the dynamic Island  and brighter screen improved cameras for  photos and videos and that new action load  but are these changes enough to justify upgrade  into the 14 pro or the pro Max now as I shoot  all the videos on my Channel with an iPhone it's  been a good opportunity to really see how the 14  pro Max performs as my daily phone so if you were  thinking of buying one of the latest iPhone 14  Pros hopefully this video will give you an idea  of what to expect now one of the biggest changes  that we've seen this year is the addition of the  dynamic Island that's the little notch or pale at  the top and I will say I do prefer this over the  notch that we've had before they've taken what is  a pretty boring Hardware feature and turned  it into this adaptive notification area yes  it protrudes slightly more into the screen but  visually I think this looks a lot nicer as for  the functionality do you know what this is more  than just a gimmick of course it's always easy to  be sucked into the Apple event hype thinking this  little island is going to change my life but it's  not bad at the moment it is quite limited so not  all apps support or use this area yet but the ones  that do do it really well things like face ID now  show up at the top incoming calls also show here  and these dynamically change the width to the  pill and there are loads more that I found as  well things like screen recording timers music  charging and even airdropping files they all  take advantage of this little area returning  to a phone call while using another app is  easier as well and I imagine over time more and  more apps will integrate here we'll see things  that we didn't even realize that we needed so  although this little notification area shouldn't  be the main reason to buy a 14 pro it's a nice  feature to have and makes using the iPhone that  a little bit easier on a day-to-day basis another  thing to mention about the screen is the bump up  in brightness this now maxes out at 2 000 nits  side by side with last year's 13 Pro it's hard  to see the difference but is when you take it  outside that you really notice it the screen is  still pretty reflective so in direct sunlight  you're going to struggle to see what's on the  screen but generally speaking the brighter screen  really does help and we've obviously got the pro  motion display so the 120 hertz adaptive screen so  scrolling through apps and pages are really smooth  oh and if you're wondering what screen protector  that I'm using this is the Spigen easy fit I'll  actually link to that below so as I mentioned I've  gone for the pro Max this year and when it comes  to the size and portability there's definitely  some pros and cons over the normal Pro the  advantage is the screen is bigger so perfect for  editing photos or watching videos or playing games  but it also has a bigger battery so less worries  about charging it but if you've got smaller hands  or you struggle to use one one-handed it can  be a problem so for example trying to tap the  dynamic Island to answer a call you're probably  going to need two hands to use it comfortably  for me the pros do outweigh the cons now I don't  mind a slightly larger phone if it means I can  enjoy editing or watching content on here and  not really worry about the battery life but if  I'm being honest I have picked up my wife's 14 pro  a couple of times and questioned whether I should  have gone smaller but overall I am happy with the  14 pro Max now this isn't a secret but I do use  an iPhone to record all of the videos for this  Channel and that's the one and only reason that  I upgrade every single year I want the best camera  that I can get from an iPhone so the fact that the  cameras have been upgraded once again is a huge  Advantage for me but do they make that much of a  difference well starting with video I shoot in 4k  30 although it will do up to 4K 60 and I can tell  you now that within the first few minutes of using  it I could tell this was noticeably better quality  than the 13 Pro it's brighter less noisy and  definitely has a bump up in overall video quality  last week's video on the channel the Sony headset  review well that was filmed entirely on the 14 pro  Max everything before this video was then filmed  on either the 13 Pro Max or the 13 mini and even  while editing this video I could see just how  good the quality looked and that's filming inside  today's video is shot between the 14 pro and the  13 Pro and it still amazing me just how good the  iPhone footage is all of this camera capability  packed into a mobile phone that's in your pocket  so that means if you want to create content which  is something I often encourage you can use the  phone that's in your pocket and the iPhone 14  pro is a perfect phone for that well we now have  four focal lengths ranging from 0.5 up to three  times and I'd say all four have seen a noticeable  upgrade in quality even the ultra wide lens  looks a lot cleaner than what we've seen before  then there's the stabilization and the standard  motion handling which is incredibly good you  could easily use the 14 pro without a gimbal while  walking through town it is super smooth but last  weekend I had to try out the new action mode that  we've seen recently added to the 14 pro and this  thing is ridiculous so what I did was I asked my  son to run down the street and I would follow him  as best as I could firstly without the action mode  on which is still very good bearing in mind I am  running sideways here while holding two phones  to try and get that shot and now I've switched  over to action mode and started running again  and considering how fast we're both running with  no gimbal this is effortlessly stable it's worth  mentioning that it does reduce the resolution to  2.7 K instead of 4K but it's not really noticeable  even showing the footage side by side here today  so I think if you need to make use of the action  mode don't really worry about the resolution but  generally speaking the standard stabilization  really is good enough and you don't really need  a gimbal so another advantage of the pro Max over  the normal Pro is the larger battery you're going  to see a few extra hours now Apple say you'll get  up to 29 hours of use but realistically I've seen  anywhere between 10 to 15 hours now that is more  than enough of my daily needs and that includes  checking socials filming videos watching YouTube  and replying to emails if I can make it through 15  hours a day without a charge I am happy with that  I normally take it off charge when I wake up in  the morning around 7am and then I put it back on  charge at 11 PM so I don't really need more than  that but the pro on the other hand that my wife  uses is borderline flat by the late evening now  there is a reason I believe that I've managed  to get a decent battery life out of mine and  that's because almost immediately I disabled the  always-on display I know this is a new feature  this year but I just don't like it I found myself  constantly looking over and getting distracted so  I can only assume this has helped slightly towards  my battery I'm talking about charging it while you  green are very kindly sent me out one of these  next sewed three-in-one fast Chargers and that's  capable of up to 140 Watts so it's similar to  what I've used before with the MacBook Pro but  the bonus is it comes with three ports instead  of just one so there's two USBC ports and one  use USB a port and this means I can charge up to  three different devices at the same time and still  only use one plug socket I can see this being used  in my kitchen or my living room where I might need  to charge my 16 inch MacBook Pro the iPhone 14  pro and anything else so here I'm using the USBC  cable to charge my PlayStation 5 controller it  even comes with a PD 3.1 USBC Cable in the Box  it also looks a little bit more compact than  the standard Apple plug which is nice plus it  has the u-green power dispenser system built in  that is designed to adjust the power between all  of the connected devices essentially it protects  the batteries from overheating I'll have a link  to this below if you want to check it out but it's  definitely something that I'll be using to replace  three plugs in my room so I've talked about how I  use the iPhone for creating my YouTube videos but  I've also taken all of my Instagram and Twitter  photos with an iPhone as well I often shoot in  raw and then edit them in Lightroom mobile but  this gives you an idea of what is capable from  just an iPhone and on the back we still have the  three lenses we've got the ultra wide a wide and  a telephoto but we now have four different Zoom  modes who have 0.5 1 2 and 3 but the biggest  change here is the fact that when shooting in Pro  raw you can make use of the 48 megapixel camera I  have always been impressed with the iPhone camera  but being able to shoot at 48 megapixels in raw  and then edit in Lightroom mobile is incredible  the detail and the information stored in these  files take edits and pictures to a whole new level  now of course you don't need to shoot in Pro raw  you can use the normal photo mode and you'll get  some awesome photos from it but it's just going  to be a compressed photo oh and another thing  the files are huge we're talking 15 to 20 times  bigger than the jpeg equivalent you won't want  to be shooting every single photo in raw just  the ones you know need editing or correcting most  of the photos I've taken float around the 50 to  80 megabytes so your space could very quickly fill  up now I'm not sure if it's because the files are  so huge but when you take multiple photos I have  noticed that the phone massively slows down so  let me show you a very quick example of the 13 Pro  Max and the 14 pro Max both taking Pro Raw photosand just for comparison the same again but both  take in normal jpeg photos I'm not sure if this  can be improved on but hopefully we'll see this  optimized by Apple via an update that's like  eight to nine second delay is painfully slow  but the photos I have taken over the last few  weeks have been awesome it's easy to say these are  better than what I could have taken on the 13 Pro  but I do feel this is more than just a placebo  effect the images really are noticeably better  so if you're shooting loads of content in 4k and  taking photos in Pro raw you're probably going to  need loads of storage and that is the main reason  that I've gone for the one terabyte option it does  seem Overkill especially as I also use the two  terabyte I cloud storage but it means I can take  as many photos and videos as I need without really  worrying I would say if you were creating content  or you planned a film in 4k and take photos in Pro  raw you'll probably want to go for at least the  512 gigabyte option one terabyte is too much for  most but then if you think you're going to keep  the phone for the next two to three years it's  probably worth upgrading now as you can never have  too much storage I think from a design and overall  look perspective it's hard to get super excited  about the iPhone Pro Models as they've kind of  looked the same for the last few years I do like  the new space black color I think in certain light  this is really nice and it's still my favorite  choice but saying that I do hide it inside a  case 99 of the time so it's almost irrelevant if  I wasn't using the case they're still band on the  side still picks up loads of fingerprints you'll  end up wiping this down quite frequently and as  for the case while I'm using the standard Apple  leather one it's not the cheapest out there and if  I'm being honest the durability isn't great but it  looks nice and it fits really well it's obviously  a shame to cover this phone up because it does  look nice out of the case but it's the best way to  protect it and compare it very quickly to the 13  Pro Max well the main differences include the  pill at the top or the dynamic Island they're  always on display two thousand nits of brightness  and finally the improved cameras putting them side  by side you would struggle to tell them apart the  new one is slightly darker in terms of the color  and the lenses are a little bit bigger but other  than that they do look practically the same and  here's the 14 pro Max against the 14 pro again  just to give you an idea of the size difference  between the two so I I think most of these new  features that we've seen on the 14 pro are nice  to have but not one of them really make this a  justifiable upgrade if you've already got a 13  Pro this feels more like a 13 Pro s rather  than the whole new model this year and the  same could be said for the normal 14 but saying  that if you want the best iPhone available right  now and you'll make use of those new features you  cannot go wrong with the 14 pro the camera upgrade  alone will make a noticeable difference at any  photo or video that you take so yeah overall I'm  really happy with the 14 pro Max and I'm looking  forward to seeing what my future videos will look  like on the channel and whether you've noticed  any Improvement already what do you think about  the quality in today's video now let me know if  you've got an iPhone already or what features  you would like to see added next time to make you  upgrade now drop a shot on iPhone in the comments  and I will give you a thumbs up for staying  right till the end and if you did enjoy today's  video check out my iPhone 14 pro accessory video  next as that covers the 10 best accessories you  should buy thanks for watching please like sub and  follow me on Instagram and Twitter until

SdLShOCvVeM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,
FztDT48cPgM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,apple did a killer job showing off theiphone 14 lineup but they convenientlyleft out 29 things both good and manynot so good now some of these willaffect which model you should buy andfor some be a good reason to buy aniphone 13 instead along with ways whereyou can actually save some money so makesure to pay attention as i go througheverything we found scouring their siteand the web let's start out with somesimple ones and then get into the juicydetails that you need to know the firstis that the iphone 14 can now have a maclike startup chime when turning oninstead of being silent so it's a nicelittle confirmation for those that wantit as far as colors they announced onlytwo new ones for the pro but they didn'tmention that the silver one is alsoupdated because the glass on the back isnow a true white instead of beingoff-white now the new space black colorlooks to be very similar to the oldgraphite on their website but in realityit is way darker which i personally likewith that we have new colors for casesas well as apple's wallets butunfortunately the white silicon casethat was very popular they are nowcompletely gone now if you're somebodythat hates camera bumps the iphone 14'sbump is not only larger but it sticksout way more than ever because of thenew 48 megapixel sensor so these thingsare going to wobble like crazy now applespent a lot of time on the new cutoutdubbed dynamic island which now lookssuper cool because of the new uifeatures that they created for it but ifit looks a bit too big for you there isa reason from an image that apple nowtook down from their website you couldsee that the visible pill is actuallylarger than the cutout that is made forthe camera and the sensors that isbecause they are going to anti-alias theedge of the pixels that they turn off onthe screen to make it look perfect evenif there is a manufacturing defect whichis a good thing because they sometimeshad issues with the original notch notbeing perfectly cut out with that unlikethe rumors wi-fi is still exactly thesame from the three-year-old iphone 11where even budger android phones likethe pixel 6a have way faster wi-fi 6e onthe positive side the new iphonesfinally have updated bluetooth 5.3 afterbeing stuck with 5.0 ever since theiphone 8 and this is great because ofthe new lc3 codec for better audioquality and lower power usage as well asbetter call quality so if you're gonnapair with the new airpods pro it's gonnabe nice apple said that the new iphone14 plus has the best battery life in anyiphone ever but that is a bit misleadingbecause that is only the case for audioplayback rated at 100 hours compared to95 on the iphone 14 pro max and forvideo playback it actually gets beat by4 hours in general the new iphones areonly one hour better than the 13s and ifyou're streaming it is the same asbefore which likely means that thetwo-year-old x60 5g modem has not beenupdated to the new four nanometer x70which is both 33 faster while savingbattery life and apple didn't mention ifthe batteries got any larger but sincethey got rid of the sim card you wouldthink that they would but the 14 pro isactually the only one that got a smallbump while the pro max actually got asmaller battery as far as charging theysell you a 20 watt adapter but the 14scan actually use up to 27 watts so ifyou're gonna buy one get anker's smaller30 watt which i'll link to in thedescription one bummer for me personallyis the e sim on the 14 pro and max theymentioned that the 14s will be ecm onlybut they didn't say anything about thepro models so i hoped if you're payingmore you will still get that slot but noit turns out they don't have it eitherwhich is a bummer for those that travelor they swap sims with an android phonenow if you're like me and you thoughtthat was for better water resistancenope it is exactly the same as theiphone 12 unlike our partner vesey whichare 100 waterproof and will change yourlife check this out vessies are madefrom dymatex which is a dual climateknit material that can be submerged andkeep your socks completely dry while atthe same time keep you really cool inthe summer so they are amazing foryear-round use they are extremelylightweight and comfortable so theydon't feel like they should bewaterproof but they are i love how minelook and vessy has a bunch of styles tochoose from so i can get some that lookgreat for work while being ready for anyunpredictable weather they're comfy fortraveling and when i go camping i don'thave to bring my boots with me and wheni did in the past i oftentimes wouldn'teven put my boots on because they'reuncomfortable and then my feet get hotso i'd wear my regular shoes and thenjust deal with my feet getting wet andsoaked and that is something that's justannoying and in the past now bessies arethe ultimate all-around shoes and youcan use my link in the description withmy code to get 25 off each pair of adultleslie shoes with free shipping and manycountries so go ahead and check them outi think you will love them another majordownside with esim that apple didn'tmention is that not everybody will beable to use it only the seven majorcarriers so you have to know about thisbefore buying with that the pros canhold up to eight e-sims at once whilefor some reason the 14s are limited tosix but of course you can only have twoactive at a time now there were rumorsthe apple was finally going to upgradethe ram to 8 gigabyte on the pro modelsbut they didn't mention ram at all atthe event and we now know why we didn'tget that upgrade to 8 gigabytes of ramso we're still stuck with 6 just likethe iphone 12s but at the same time theregular iphone 14s also now have sixgigabytes as far as performance somepeople were upset that for the firsttime ever apple is reusing an older chipin a new high-end iphone and only thepros are getting the new a16 but inreality it doesn't matter because thereisn't that much of a difference appletold us how much better it was comparedto the competition but unlike all of theprevious launches they didn't compare itto the previous chips they werereplacing now the first performancebenchmark showed a slight increase insingle core but practically the samemulti-core performance which was abummer but it looks like somebody elseran it today and the multi-coreperformance is up 17 compared to the a15now one detail that many missed is thatthe identifier is different meaning thatit is possible that the 14 pro mightperform the same as the 14 but the 14pro max actually gets that boost becauseit could dissipate heat better we alsojust got a graphics performance scoreand it is up eight percent compared tolast year but once again this is fromthe 14 pro max now i really wish thatapple talked more about thermalperformance and how they compare betweendifferent models on stage what they didmention is the lower power usage becauseof the four nanometer design but unlikethe iphone 14 they didn't say that the14 pros have improved cooling so there'sstill a chance that we might have todeal with screen dimming like we did onthe 13 pros especially if you'll beusing that 2000 nit brightness for theoutdoors that really will heat updisplay that is one thing that we willhave to put to the test once we get allfour of the iphone models that we'rebuying so if you want to see that makesure you're subscribed apple showed offthe full iphone lineup on stage with themini being canned but it turns out thatthey are still selling the 13 mini andit is now 100 cheaper so if you stillwant a mini it is now 599 bucks butbetter yet if you recently bought itthey can actually do a price adjustmentto get you a hundred dollars back somake sure you take advantage of thatdiving into prices more everybody washappy that apple didn't raise them untilthey started looking at the order pageand found out that the 14 pro max is 150euros more expensive now and the 14 is ahundred years more expensive while the13 is still available at the same priceso if you're outside of the us yes thesedid get more expensive and even crazieris that the iphone sc3 went up by 30euros after the event for no reason atall just you know maybe inflation moneyother stuff same exact phone so if youwanted to buy one of those hopefully youalready did now apple really marketedthe iphone 14 but in reality it isactually the brains of the 13 pro butwith things like pro motion disabled ithas five gpu cores in the a15 and it hassome of the cameras as well which alsomakes it weird that the 13s aren'tgetting the software upgrades for thephotonic engine even though the hardwarefully supports it touching on camerasnow the 48 megapixel camera looks greaton the pros and the upgraded ultrawidedoes as well but if it seemed like applecompletely skimmed over the three timestelephoto camera they did so much sothat they didn't even have a specgraphic for it that is because it is thesame exact one as the 13 pro so won't beable to keep up with many of the androidphones and the focusing will still missat times with that the iphone 14 stillcannot use night mode for portraits sojust like the iphone 12 series portraitsand darker lighting will still look badthe new action mode they showed off doeslook super smooth but apple didn'tmention that the video quality is worsebecause of the heavy cropping and itwill not be able to shoot in 4k so keepthat in mind that you are not gettingthe best quality so if you're not doingthings like running like crazy you mightnot want to use it for those of you thatbuy apple care plus they also didn'tmention that it has been upgraded withunlimited repairs as long as you keeppaying so if you're somebody that breakstheir phone often and you want to keepyour phone for a long time this will begreat one of the most game-changingfeatures is satellite connectivity foremergencies now you may have missed itbut apple snuck in that it's free fortwo years so at some point it will bepaid now globalstar apple's providercharges 12 bucks a month for the serviceif you're using their spot x which youhave to buy now let me know if you'd bewilling to pay that much once your freecoverage runs out a new feature thatwill come alongside the new iphones iscounterfeit airpod detection built intoios 16 which is great for those of youguys that want to buy a used set becausesome people do buy knockoffs for supercheap and then resell them for way morepretending that they're just used onesor maybe new so that will definitely puta stop to it and help you know thatyou're actually buying genuine ones butit won't block them out if you want tobuy a pair of knockoffs and save somemoney so there you guys go we have abunch of things that apple did notmention let me know down below whichones really stood out to you or whichones matter and we will be getting thesenew phones and doing a bunch ofcomparisons and tests see if the camerasare that much better than the previousgenerations so make sure you guys clickthat subscribe button above check outvesey's down below and check out one ofthose two videos as well thank you forwatching this

IzbxX55UTIg,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,hi everyone Aaron here for zollotech and the  iPhone 14 pro Max has been out for about a  week or so at this point and it's been my main  device ever since I've been using it 100 of the  time with my SIM card or now esim inside of  it and wanted to share the overall good and  bad experiences from everything from the battery  life to the display and much more so we'll start  with the good and then we'll finish off talking  about what might not be so good and then maybe  if you should pick one up or maybe stick with what  you currently have now the display this year is a  big upgrade from the previous year now many people  may or may not be talking about this but it's an  upgrade in many ways it seems to be a little bit  sharper this year and also it's incredibly bright  so in outdoor sunlight it's very easy to see in  fact I was using it outdoors and as you can see  here it looks fine there's no problem seeing it  whatsoever it's nice and vibrant and goes up to 2  000 nits I even didn't have a problem with it  dimming down as it was getting a little bit  warmer out so I didn't let it sit for any amount  of time but in just using it regularly I never saw  it dimmed down and the phone didn't get too hot  where it actually needed to pull that brightness  down of course it goes up to 1600 nits with HDR  footage and just looks great overall it has great  viewing angles of course we have to talk about  the dynamic Island though the dynamic Island at  the top is something you either love or you don't  think is as good as the Notch and what Apple has  done is take the sensors make them smaller put  them in sort of a pill is what we called it before  and then a hole punch for the camera but then  they've filled in the pixels in between and then  just shut them off so it looks all dark across  the top of it you can see in bright sunlight that  you can actually notice the difference between  the two sensors but in regular use you don't  really see that so inside it's very hard to see  unless you're in bright light and at the certain  Angle now also with this Dynamic Island Apple  has actually done something that's very Apple  like and made it playful so whether you're in  a song We'll go into this song press play swipe  home it goes up to the dynamic Island if we  go into maybe a clock start a timer swipe home  it does the same thing and then splits the dynamic  Island if you want to go back into that app tap on  the app if you want to get maybe a media player  press and hold on music and you'll get the media  player and everything is nicely color matched to  the album art to the waveform from the audio it  looks really great however in regular practice  it's not something that I find other than it  looking great is something that I really want to  use all the time because it's at the top of the  screen so it is a bit of a stretch to interact  with pushing your thumb up there you really  need to use two hands and then sort of press one  hand at the top while holding the phone normally  that's something that I think is really nice to  have there but is something I find that might be  like the touch bar in that it's an information  panel that you don't interact with too much but  it definitely looks really nice and is something  that I appreciate especially how different app  developers have taken advantage of this I showed  this in one other video but if we go into the app  Apollo which is for Reddit and within this app  you you can see at the top they have something  called pixel Pals where you have a little pet  that walks across the top of the dynamic Island  Walks from edge to edge actually goes to sleep  and it's just sort of a little fun interactive  thing they've done with the dynamic Island I think  if developers take advantage of this use this more  and more it'll be something I welcome as it's just  sort of a fun playful thing that feels very Apple  so I do like this but there is one disadvantage  to the dynamic Island and that's with YouTube so  if we go into YouTube and then maybe we play a  video that's in 18 by nine aspect ratio what I  post many of my videos in it actually fills in  around the I was going to say Notch but around  the dynamic Island so you can see it here where  it's sort of cut into the video itself if we  expand the video it goes around the dynamic Island  so that's something that may bother people and I  may need to change my content to 16x9 so it's  not interfering with that but so far it does  interfere on all videos if they're in 18x9 also  with this display pwm or pulse with modulation  has been a concern from many of you viewers so  many of you have asked me is it a problem for  you and it wasn't a problem for me with the 13  Pro Max about 1 in 10 people are sensitive to it  and if you're not familiar with it it's how an  OLED display controls brightness by flickering  the display faster or slower this display doesn't  seem to pose any problem whatsoever and I've heard  that from a lot of you where it really doesn't  bother your eyes at all in fact at 240 frames  per second it's almost undetectable so in many  situations it's very hard to actually see that  means the pwm rate is so high that it shouldn't  bother your eyes at all or they're just using DC  dimming and they're also using a one Hertz refresh  rate when they drop it down when you're using an  always-on display and that's another good thing  for this phone the always on display is something  I really like it's very helpful and dims based on  the overall ambient light around you so if I turn  the lights off here you'll see that it will dim  down a little bit more so maybe you're going to  sleep you've put it on your bed stand and it dims  down when the lights come back on it will increase  the brightness using the sensors and it looks nice  it has some color to it and it's better than any  other always on display I've seen however I would  like some options for this to maybe just have the  clock but it doesn't have that you can turn it off  as it will take a little hit to your battery about  one percent or less per hour but it's something  that I would really consider leaving on as it's  a feature of the phone but either way if you're  concerned about battery you could turn that off  but I think that's definitely a positive of  this phone the a16 bionic this year doesn't  get a bump in Ram but it definitely is fast  so anytime you're scrolling through anything  Pro motion just seems smoother everything  is just incredibly smooth and when you're  playing music like I showed before you swipe  up the interactions with the dynamic Islander  smooth going back and forth between apps is smooth  they've sort of made this an iOS 6 experience as  far as overall smoothness and that's something  I definitely appreciate so whether you're going  into something simple just as settings going  back and forth scrolling going back to music  or just swiping something into the dynamic Island  it's just super fluid all the time more so than I  remember in the past yes phones have been fast  but there's something slightly different about  this one at least in my experience that I really  appreciate as far as benchmarks it just kind of  blows anything else out of the water as far as  that goes so as we wait for this to open we go  to the history you'll see even after installing  certain updates it's just incredibly fast so much  faster than just about anything else out there  as far as overall benchmarks and usability feels  the same as far as that goes in my experience  I've heard from others this isn't the case but  I see this as a positive the back has not gotten  warm hardly at all just during filming this video  it's barely warm and that's thanks to the four  nanometer process you can see the overall heat  signature from the back of it really isn't that  warm at all it's staying nice and cool and I've  had no issues I've heard from others that  have had those issues but I personally have  had those issues the cameras this year get  a massive upgrade but I think many people  overlooked the forward-facing camera Apple has  given it auto focus and an upgraded sensor that  makes it one of the best cameras for video I've  seen in a long time it makes it much easier where  you just put it on the camera and then point  it at yourself and start talking to it and you  really don't need to do a whole lot of editing  and post as far as colors or anything else it  looks good and is much better than previous years  in fact the beginning of this video was filmed  with it without any external mic or anything and  I'll film the end of the video with it as well  the rear cameras are great too of course we have  a upgraded 48 megapixel sensor which makes some  incredible photos you can see a few of them here  and so it takes all of that information and I  don't think you'll notice too much of a difference  between this camera and a 13 Pro Max until you  zoom in once you zoom in you can see a lot more  detail since you have more data there and you also  have up to 15 stops of dynamic range According to  some people who have tested this further than I  can now that you have an upgraded Ultra wide which  has great macro shots as well and then a telephoto  and one thing they've done that's really great  this year is when you transition between those  when you're in video it's super smooth so when  you go from 1X to 3x or back out to ultra wide  it's just super smooth overall so that's something  I think is really underappreciated that just as  great if you're filming video and you want to  zoom in and make it smooth and not have to do  that afterward action mode is also something they  added this year and that works really well so you  can see here as I'm walking along with and without  action mode what it looks like across this bridge  I think it looks pretty good it's great especially  if you were running maybe across a backyard it  really stabilizes that footage but you will lose  a little bit of quality just because it has to  sort of cut into the video to make that work and  you can see when you turn it on it drops down to  2.8 K so you can upscale that to 4K but it will  lose some of that resolution when it's actually  trying to stabilize overall but it does a great  job we also have 4K in cinematic mode this year  so that's a nice addition something that I don't  use too much just because I don't use cinematic  mode I prefer to just film everything myself but  either way it's an available option now if you  want it also those who use the flash will find  it much improved so I think they'll appreciate  that quite a bit if you do use a flash it's not  something I typically use but if you use it it  definitely looks better than previous years now  we also have to mention a couple other positives  as far as car crash detection so we have car crash  detection that's not something I'm willing to test  you'd physically need to be in a car crash and  also it listens from the microphone and senses  with barometric pressure and then High G-Force  that you've been in a crash and then will alert  authorities if you need to need them to know or  you could cancel that if it wasn't anything too  serious but it's nice to have that built in of  course satellite connectivity comes to our phones  but that's later on so there's no way to test that  just yet but having that option maybe you're in  the middle of nowhere you've lost signal at least  you can reach some authorities or let someone  know where you are that's something I definitely  think is a positive overall connectivity seems to  be quite good for me this year they've updated  the modem and you'll see I have two bars of 5G  you see as far as the overall speed that can vary  greatly but I've noticed I've had less drops using  this device and calls seem to be clearer overall  you'll see with 5G I'm hitting over well I hit 180  plus megabits per second for just a moment there  and that's only with two bars in a brick building  so 80 megabits per second is more than fast enough  you only need about 15 or so to watch a 4K video  and with uploads we're hitting about 11 megabits  per second or so on LTE I would get about 60 as  far as the overall download here so I'd say that's  pretty good given that I'm inside a brick building  and it works really well for me I've had no issues  whatsoever and notice a little bit faster speed  this here Apple's upgraded Bluetooth to Bluetooth  5.3 and with that I've noticed a little bit of a  difference whether it just be the Bluetooth modem  they're using overall whether that's the new sort  of standard they're using I noticed connectivity  seems to be better so if we open up airpods Pro  here give it a second to connect I noticed that  the connections are more consistent and seem to  have less issues so it did take a moment to  connect I really haven't noticed a difference  as far as that goes but with other Bluetooth  accessories such as car keys so I use a Tesla app  to connect to my car when I walk up close to it I  notice that it actually unlocks more consistently  without any issues in previous versions the 13 Pro  Max I would have to actually sometimes go into the  up and then unlock the car now it consistently  allows me to unlock it even from further  distances so I've noticed that not just with  that app but also air pods and other Bluetooth  connected devices it seems to be a little bit  better this year now before we talk about the  negative things or bad things overall with the 14  pro Max let's talk a little bit about something  that's in between good and bad and that's the  battery with the settings set up as default and  always on display left on I get through a day with  about the same amount left around 50 percent left  in my battery however when I compared it to the  previous year looking at the battery statistics  it was actually about an hour less battery despite  Apple saying it should be about an hour more or  the same so an hour more playing video or about  the same doing everything else that's due to the  more efficient chipset inside however my battery  statistics prove that it's about an hour less at  least for my usage so if we take a look at the  last seven days you'll see I had three hours and  46 minutes on one day with 3 hours and 53 minutes  of screen off time and use about 55 percent of my  battery life based off of that looking year over  year on the previous review that was done after  the same amount of time it's about an hour  less of screen on time so that's something  I'm experiencing just from My overall use you may  experience more it depends on what you use and if  you leave the always on display on I personally  like it so I'm going to leave it on but if you're  running out of battery by the end of the day you  may need to disable some of those settings now as  far as the overall battery size Apple actually  made it smaller so getting similar battery life  or a little less was to be expected at 4 323  milliamp hours but it's just something to note  now as far as the first negative thing I would  say that has to do with price outside of the  USA the price in the USA is the exact same so  it's still an expensive phone but they haven't  bumped the price up at all however outside the  USA it's significantly more in some countries  whether that's due to different currency changes  or just the overall tax rates and things like that  it's definitely more expensive in other countries  and for a lot of people that's going to stop them  from upgrading this year so it was something worth  mentioning also some people may not like that the  camera bump is larger for me it's not a problem  but some people that really don't like it well  if you're not into cameras then this might not be  for you because it has a huge camera bump on it  something that personally is negative to me or bad  to me is the app will remove the SIM card tray now  this may not bother a lot of people but if you're  someone like me that tests phones it's just easier  to pop that SIM card out and put it in another  phone to test out the phone yes you can press a  button to transfer it but I would prefer to have  a physical Sim the rest of the world gets it the  USA doesn't so they've just put a spacer inside  according to those that have torn down the phone  and there's nothing there they've just filled the  void with a spacer I would rather have the SIM  card tray this year but I do think that's a bit  of an experiment maybe for the iPhone 15 I'm not  sure what the point is there but I would rather  have the SIM card tray also another negative for  me is the lightning cable I really want this to  be USBC for faster transfer speeds to me it makes  the camera using prores almost pointless because  it takes so long to get the footage off the phone  so when you're using prores it uses a tremendous  amount of space and this is a 512 gigabyte model  and with all my apps on here I have 52 minutes of  footage left but to get that 52 minutes of footage  off could take up to an hour Sometimes using  lightning if we had USBC it definitely would  be better so a faster way whether it be Wireless  through AirPlay or airdrop rather that would be  much more welcome in my opinion than just having  lightning here for the transferring large files  so hopefully we'll see that next year and then  the final negative or bad thing maybe the color  selection this year purple is the new color and  if you don't like purple you have the option for  space black and then your regular silver and gold  colors so for me I would personally prefer maybe a  different color the purple does look really nice  but it's not for everyone I do like purple I'll  probably continue using it but a different color  selection maybe orange like we've heard for years  might be something that people would welcome  a little more I haven't heard many people say  bad things about purple but I've heard more than  normal that I would with even Sierra blue or or  any of the other colors over the past few years  now if you're wondering if you should upgrade to  a 14 pro Max or maybe hold on to your 13 Promax  it really comes down to a couple of different  things whether you care about the camera or the  overall display the dynamic island or if you don't  care about any of those things well then I would  just wait until the following year usually after  three years Apple redesigns their phones anyway so  with the iPhone 15 I would expect a full redesign  whether that be they make the camera flush to  the back they increase the battery life or do  something completely different that's what Apple  typically does after three years so if you don't  care about the features as far as the camera and  the display well then I would probably hold off  you'll get iOS updates for the next few years  and then you can see what Apple comes out with  next year or the following year but if you care  a lot about the camera or you care a lot about  the dynamic island or the display itself I would  definitely upgrade for me those are reasons to  upgrade I can use them for YouTube videos in  fact we're recording in 4k cinematic mode on  the forward-facing camera now so that gives you an  idea of what it looks like if none of the things  I mentioned though matter like I said the camera  or the display just wait until the next year or  maybe a couple years whatever works for you let  me know your thoughts overall on the 14 pro Max  or the 14 did you pick up any of the phones are  you waiting for yours I'd love to hear from you  in the comments below if you haven't subscribed  already though please subscribe and if you enjoyed  the video please give it a like as always thanks  for watching I'll see you next time thank you
AUsw5zTZPzc,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,whoa the 14 plus is overheating like madApple finally gave us a large screenless expensive phone but should you justspend the extra 200 and get all of theextra features of the 14 pro Max welltoday we are going to cover every singledifference starting from the design andcomfort to the displays the new DynamicIsland versus the notch the performancebattery life and more I'll be using the14 pro Max for over two weeks now so I'mexcited to check out this phone andright away the first thing that standsout is the weight of this phone and allthese fingerprints that are on thisthing already personally I do think thatthe 14 pro Max is a little too heavy soI prefer the lighter weight and thecrazy thing is that the 14 pro that'smuch smaller is actually heavier thanthe 14 plus and that is because of thehuge camera system on the 14 pro we'regoing to talk about that in just a bitalong with the stainless steel on thethe pro phones compared to aluminum nowI like the shiny stainless steel but itis a big fingerprint magnet but the plusside is that it is more durable for dropprotection and other than that all ofthe other glass is identical in terms ofhardness now in terms of comfort in thehand I would definitely give it to the14 plus just because that shiny backgives you a lot of extra grip so if youdon't like using a case that is nicetaking a look at the front so the firstthing I notice is of course the dynamicIsland and that regular Notch you guyslet me know which one looks better butI've been using the dynamic Island for afew weeks and I love it now when I'mrunning a timer it shows up there thesame thing with music it just pops intothere you can see what's playing youhave access to shortcuts Maps pop upthere as well and then it literally isgoing to give you directions and thismorning I had a notification thereshowing me that my airpods case is lowand I was able to see that so just theextra convenience is nice and as timegoes on we're gonna get more in morefeatures added to that instead of justhaving that regular Notch the otherthing I noticed is that the bezels areSlimmer on the 14 pro Max but that's nota huge difference now there's a lot ofother differences with the screen itselfwe'll cover that in just a bit but thefirst thing I want to do is test out thespeakers because the 14 pro Max soundsamazing and I'm hoping that the 14 plusdoes as well let's take a listenI'm so happy that these thingspractically sound identical because the14 pro Max was such an upgrade sothankfully Apple didn't cheap out on thespeakers on the 14

ability to run at120hz and then slow all the way down toone Hertz for the always-on display or24 Hertz if you're watching a movie nowyou guys are seeing some slow motionshots because it's really kind of hardto show this off in regular video but inthe real world the 14 pro Max just feelsso smooth compared to slightly stutteryon the 14 plus now with that said Ithink most people are going to buy a 14plus have not tried Pro motion so youwon't really miss it but if you try bothout it's a big difference now the otherbig difference is display brightness Ihave these both maxed out in manual andthe 14 pro Max looks slightly brightereven though you think it's a biggerdifference a thousand nits compared to800 for typical turning on autobrightness and stepping outside in thesun the pro Max is able to reach 2 000nits compared to about a thousand maybe1200 on the 14 plus but I gotta behonest I was expecting a biggerdifference and I'm having a hard timebelieving that the 14 plus is limited toto 800 and that 1200 it looks like it'sactually brighter and apple is underestimating it now we also have adifference with HDR video the 14 pro Maxcan reach 1600 nits compared to 1200 andlooking at it I can see it's brighterespecially with that motorcycle shot butfor the most part I was expecting abigger difference and once again I thinkthat the 14 plus is actually doing abetter job than what Apple States interms of brightness as far as detailthey look the same they're both verysharp displays contrast looks great andif we go ahead and stretch out thevideos with the notch I personally thinkit's a little bit less distracting eventhough it's larger because with the 14pro Max you have video off to the sidethat kind of makes that Dynamic Islandpop a bit more than the regular Notchbut you guys let me know what yourpreference is down in the comments andnow let's talk about performance the 14plus has the a15 bionic with the 5 CoreGPU from last year's Pro phone and thepro Max has the new a16 now we're goingto test out the performance I'm going togo ahead and run geekbench's CPU testbut look at that Ram right there I justhave to say with real world use the lasttwo weeks I have not noticed the 14 proMax being any faster than my previous 13Pro the scores are in and we have adifference of eight percent and singlecore and about 15in multi-core so even on a percentagebasis it is not huge sure the 14 per Maxa little bit more powerful but I thinkthe fact that this year Apple added insix gigs of RAM to the cheaper phonesjust like the pros that makes a realworld difference with apps staying openlonger in the background now as far asgraphics performance I'm going to runthe compute test here and both of theseprocessors have five core graph ethicslast year's 13 had a slower 4 core solet's see the difference now here we gowith the graphics and the difference is25and with that the a16 actually uses alittle bit less power to achieve thisscore we'll talk about battery life injust a sec now I've been gaming with the14 pro Max and it has done a great jobbut I think the bigger deal is justhaving a large display it makes it somuch nicer in your hand and with thateven though the a15 is weaker in thetoughest test which is genshin it wasbarely any slower so as of now you'renot gonna notice the difference I meanwe do have that promotion display sosome games might look a little smootherif they're not super tough on thegraphics but I think the bigger deal isif you're gonna have the 14 plus wellthat is when games are going to beharder and the 14 pro Max will start tohave a bigger difference in performancenow personally what I'm very curiousabout is display dimming Apple said thatthey improved the thermal performance ofthese phones and last year the 13 ProMax and the pros they would dim quite abit because they got hot so let's reignin tutu and we'll see how they do whoalook at that guys the 14 pro Max alreadydimmed down whereas the 14 plus has notnow it has less graphics performance soit's making less frames I mean look atthat right there you guys see that whitepage and how much dimmer it is now I didstart with both phones really bright andmatching up and that is what you need ifyou're going to be playing outside in abright room and unfortunately the 14 proMax my personal phone is not doing sowell there you go now the 14 plus dimmeddown as well whoa the 14 plus isoverheating like mad so the 14 prostarted getting too hot quicker but it'smaintaining its performance now let'sgrab our thermal camera here as you guyscan see the 14 plus is slightly hotterbut there's a lot more heat there andit's spread out more so and even nowthere's been a minute after the gamingtest the screen is still dimmer on the14 plus so with that said if you reallycare about gaming go for the pro Max andnow let's talk about battery life the 14plus actually has a larger battery thanthe 14 pro Max and with that I have beendisappointed with the battery life frommy 14 pro Max using it with daily use Imentioned the always-on display for abrief bit in the beginning it is soconvenient to have that but it doesdrain your battery same thing with thecrazy brightness with that 2000 nitdisplay and it's been worse than myphone last year now a few people havedone comparisons as far as battery lifedetect shop did a good one but withthose you're not testing out standbytime or having the bright displayrunning so I want to do a real worldbattery life where you're actually usingthe phone with auto brightness just likeyou would in the real world so if youguys want to see that go ahead and makesure you guys are subscribed withnotifications enabled but from thesimple test they're showing about 30minutes more so on the 14 plus and nowthe cameras which is probably one of thebiggest reasons somebody want to buy the14 pro Max it has the extra three timesoptical zoom lens that gives you betterquality the new 48 megapixel sensor andeven though the selfie cameras areidentical there is a difference inprocessing now I'm actually doing a verydetailed camera comparison testing outall the modes testing out video and thatshould be going up tomorrow so if youguys want to see that make sure you'resubscribed as well so let me know whatyour thoughts is the 14 plus worth thesavings or should you spend the extramoney personally I think you should forthe 14 pro Max check out one of thosegreat videos right over there and we'llsee you in the next one[Music]
FmOreMQdVHI,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"So people who follow this channel know that I'm a huge Android fan.I've been using Android phones for almost a decade now.I've used iPhones before but never really liked them.But the iPhone 14 Pro Max was intriguing so I got one and I've been using it for a monthnow as my daily driver.There are a few things that I like about this phone and a few that I absolutely don't.So without much ado, let's get right into the review.First of all, let's talk about the one thing that totally saved the iPhone 14 Pro Max fromall the mockery on the internet, the dynamic island.It turned this eyesore into a well-thought-out interactive UI element.Apple designed the Dynamic Island to change in size and shape depending on what's beingdisplayed.When you unlock your ‌iPhone‌, for example, you'll see the unlock icon or when you connectthe charger, you can see the charging status, and you can control the music, timer, andmore.Third-party apps can also take advantage of this so it is one of the best things aboutthe phone purely because it is so refreshing.Now where I was wrong with the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the always-on display.When I first got the phone, I really liked it because you know it was different thanwhat others were doing.It was smart as well because it automatically turns off when you leave the phone in a roomand walk out while wearing an Apple Watch.Also, it turns off when the phone is in your pocket or face down on a table, thus helpingto save battery life while the device is not in use.So it was pretty cool.But there are a couple of reasons why I turned it off.Because a) it's distracting.There were many times in a day I got fooled into thinking I got a notification becausethe display is literally on all the time taking “Always On” rather literally.But the biggest reason I turned it off is that it was sipping battery like there wasno tomorrow.I found that the phone lost around 20% more battery when it was on so I just decided toget rid of it and turned it off.Apple should have gone Samsung's way because it's so subtle, it isn't distracting, andeven though the always-on display on Samsung phones does consume battery, not as much asApple's, Samsung does give an option to only show the clock when you tap the display whichbasically doesn't consume battery at all.So Apple had the potential to create something magical, but the experience falls flat ratherspectacularly.But the overall display is great.Outdoor viewing is not a problem at all because of the crazy brightness, the true tone workswell, and the colors and contrast were on point.There's nothing you can complain about the display.But what I would like to complain about is the phone's weight and pointy edges.Yes, the stainless steel finish does look premium and I really like the flat sides.It feels good when you pick the phone up but when you hold it for a longer period of time,it starts to get really uncomfortable because of the pointy edges and the weight.But overall I like the design, the purple looks really good in the right light conditions.Because depending on the light it either looks purple or gray.One thing I noticed with other YouTubers is that when the S22 Ultra was launched everyonecriticized the design of the camera module because it was a dirt magnet.And I agree, it does accumulate dust.But those same people didn't say a word about the 14 Pro Max's camera module.If that was a dirt magnet, this is a dirt magnet Pro Max.The fact that it's glossy and has an even bigger camera bump, it easily attracts dustand it looks bad.I was wiping the camera module multiple times a day while I was filming B rolls and evenafter that, it doesn't look clean.So there's that.Coming from the S22 Ultra, I was a little surprised to find out that iPhones don't supportreverse wireless charging, the multitasking is a joke in iPhones you only get a picturein picture mode and no split screen mode like on Samsung phones.The notifications are still a mess in iOS but credit where the credit is due, the phoneis superfluid.I really like the animations of iOS on this phone, every single animation is well thoughtout from the unlocking animation to the app opening and closing, and the dynamic islandanimations.I was really impressed.Even third-party apps such as Twitter function so smoothly on this phone.For some reason, Twitter stutters a lot on Samsung phones.So if we talk about the overall performance, this thing is a powerhouse, it can handleanything you throw at it, doesn't matter how heavy the game is or how taxing the productivityapp is.It was a pleasant experience.Speaking of experience, I was quite impressed with the battery life.I was easily getting the phone the last two days when I was just using the phone to watchmovies, YouTube, and social media sites.Even when I was taking the phone out to take photos and 4K videos with a little gamingand a lot of YouTube and social media usage, I still end up with around 20 to 30% chargeat the end of the day.That wasn't the case with the S22 Ultra though.If I were to choose a phone where I don't have to worry about the battery and can heavilyuse the phone when I don't have access to the charging port, I will choose the iPhone14 Pro Max on any given day.Now coming to the camera, Apple finally jumped onto the higher megapixel bandwagon.The 14 Pro Max now has a 48MP main camera and it takes excellent photos: The image qualityand details are great for a phone.The colors look good and the textures are great.In broad daylight both the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra take similar photos fromthe main camera, there's a minor difference between the two but you really have to golooking for it.But it's at low light, you start seeing some differences and it all boils down to post-processing.Apple’s been ramping up the amount of noise reduction and sharpening it does over theyears, and the 14 Pro has the most aggressive sharpening and noise reduction yet.The S22 Ultra consistently holds on to more color detail in low light, and it’s notas heavy-handed with noise reduction and sharpening.In true Samsung fashion, you get much punchier and warmer colors compared to the more naturallook of the iPhone.The same is the case in the low light video as well.as you can see the 14 Pro Max is more aggressive with noise reduction but it's the S22 Ultrathat holds on to the colors really well.Yes, there's some noise but overall it captures a little better low-light video.But in good lighting conditions, both phones perform similarly.Apple has improved the cinematic mode quite a lot this year.No, you're not going to get a DSLR type of blur but they are slowly getting there.Now where the iPhone 14 Pro Max falls behind is in zoom.The S22 Ultra has a dedicated periscope zoom lens which the 14 Pro Max doesn't so it'snot really an apple to apple comparison but at this price point, a phone must have a periscopezoom camera.So if we talk about the overall camera performance, I would say the 14 Pro Max is right up therewith the S22 Ultra for the best smartphone camera of the year.It's only when you extensively start looking for the difference, you start noticing thedifference.So overall the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a great phone, you're not going to go wrong with this.You should buy this if you have the 11 Pro or lower because I don't think the changesare that significant for 12 Pro and 13 Pro users.And as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to keep using the S22 Ultra as my main phoneand keep the 14 Pro Max as my second phone because, for me, iOS is very limiting.I'm also a PC user, and the iPhone and PC don't communicate really well.There's no periscope zoom either, no S Pen and I like the look of the S22 Ultra more.If you liked the review, do hit that like button, it helps the channel and I'll seeyou tomorrow...peace out"
qrT-AuhN4yw,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,So we've just had Apple's new far out of bed and  we've just seen the brand new iPhone 14 models  lineup we do have the iPhone 14 pro Max but we  also have the brand new iPhone 14 plus so what  I want to do for you today is a comparison  of the iPhone 14 pro Max and the iPhone 14  plus the iPhone 14 plus has features like the  a15 chipset what's exactly the same ones in the  iPhone 13 Pro Models but also on the iPhone 14 pro  Max we do have a triple camera setup and there's  lots of other things to compare so today what I'm  going to do for you is I'm going to do an iPhone  14 plus versus the iPhone 14 pro max review of  specs comparison and without further Ado let's  begin so then as you can see here we have the  iPhone 14 pro Max on the left side and we also  have the new iPhone 14 plus on the right side  and that's going to be the same during all of  this comparison so let's begin with it then so  we've got the display type first of all so both  of these phones have an OLED display and this OLED  display we've had oleds now so since the iPhone 10  that's when they were first introduced but every  single model of the iPhone has an OLED apart from  the SE model since the iPhone 12 so there's  no difference here except for the OLED on the  iPhone 14 pro Max is a little bit more brighter  especially like in daylight so you can get up to 2  000 nits of brightness on this compared to  the normal iPhone 14 plus then for the actual  screen size they're actually identical they're  exactly the same the actual same body is very  very similar so it's a 6.7 inch display for both  of these models there's no difference here the  only main differences obviously you do get that  Dynamic Island and you also get the notch on the  14 plus so that's the way how you'll actually see  your display you either get the island or you get  the notch so you get to choose one there which one  you prefer to have the actual screen resolution  though the actual screen is actually a 16x9 from  both of these iPhones and the resolution you get  with that is 2278 by 1284 and that's identical  for both the models and that basically translates  to in pixels per inch 458 pixels per inch or 458  PPI for both of the models again exactly the same  there's no difference here the display refresh  rate there this is where things do change so with  the iPhone 14 plus you get the standard 60 hertz  display what you've had for a long time now but  with the iPhone 14 pro Max you actually get a 120  hertz Pro motion display and that can go all the  way down to one Hertz on all day up to 120 hertz  and when it's down at one Hertz you can actually  use that always on display that's come out for  the iPhone 14 Pro Models including the pro Max  where's the iPhone 14 plus doesn't have this  capability full display protection though they  both do have ceramic Shield what is very similar  to the Gorilla Glass that's out there right now  like on Android phones so it's very very good  and very very strong but then we move on to the  processor and the CPU and this is where things do  change a fair bit here we do have the a16 by Onyx  and we have the a15 bionic so the iPhone 14 plus  has the a15 bionic and this is funny enough is the  exact same chipset that was in the iPhone 13 Pro  and also the iPhone 13 Pro Max last year but the  iPhone 14 pro Max and the 14 pro this year has a  brand new a16 by Onyx chipset inside it was even  more efficient than what we got with the a15 it is  a little bit more faster as well not too much in  the multi-core but in single core it definitely is  but the main thing is to do with efficiency it is  far far more efficient in the a16 but the cores  on both these are built up of a 5 Core GPU and  then for the CPU it is a four core efficiency  course and two core performance cause however  one other thing that has also changed is the ram  both of these iPhones do have the same amount of  ram inside them what is six gigabytes for both  the models however with the iPhone 14 plus you  do get LP ddr4x Ram what's the same sort of ram  that's been used in the last couple of generations  of the iPhone with the previous chipsets but with  the iPhone 14 pro Max it's actually using lpddr5  Ram or is a bit more faster to access so really  putting stuff into your temporal memory what  you have inside your phone the iPhone 14 pro Max  will be a little bit more quicker at doing that  then for storage amounts there is a difference  here as well so with the iPhone 14 pro Max it  starts at 128 gigabyte and goes all the way up to  one terabyte whereas the iPhone 14 plus starts at  128 gigabytes but only goes up to 512 gigabytes  there's no one terabyte option so if you do want  even more storage you will need to go for a pro or  Pro Max model then we actually have the operating  system inside and both of these phones can run  iOS 16 and they both get things like the satellite  connectivity for emergency calls and text they  also get car crash detection but the iPhone 4  team pro Max does actually get one or two extra  features with that new Dynamic Island instead of  having the notch now there's a few extra features  inside that but essentially apart from this they  are very very similar in how they run iOS 16.  then we have the actual battery size and really  I actually going to say this both the phones have  the exactly same battery inside them the iPhone  14 plus does have two milliamps more what is I  can't even imagine it's about 0.1 more battery  than the iPhone 14 pro Max so really if you ram  both of these phones up to 10 hours maybe the 14  plus would do 10 hours but the iPhone 14 pro Max  would probably do 9 hours 59 minutes and say 30  seconds it'd be like 30 seconds behind it there's  nothing in it whatsoever but then having said that  it does have the pro motion display the iPhone  14 pro Max so really again if the actual refresh  rate is lower than say 60 hertz with the iPhone 14  plus does normally run up what you're doing your  apps or whatever you're doing on your phone then  technically speaking the iPhone 14 pro Max battery  would last longer so really though there's quite  a lot of different other things you've also got to  factor in the a16 in chipset as well but it's also  more efficient than the iPhones 14s plus a15 so  there's that side of it too it is really basically  these phones are neck and neck in battery sort of  capability then after this we have the wired and  wireless charging and both the phones do have 20  watts cable connection by lightning and also  they have the magsafe connectivity what is 15  watts what's exactly the same that we got since  the iPhone 12. then after this the actual weight  of the phones the iPhone 14 pro Max comes in at  240 grams whereas the iPhone 14 plus is a little  lighter at 200 and 3 grams so the 14 pro Max  is a little bit more understandable because it  does have that extra sensor so it's going to be  a little bit more heavier with that camera lens  then water resistance both of these phones are  identical they're ip68s and most iPhones I mean  ip68 for some years now and this basically allows  you that if you did drop your phone into Clear  Water survive up to 30 minutes up to 6 meters in  depth of water so they're both identical in this  as well after this we do actually have the ports  on the iPhones so both of the phones actually  have a lightning connection this year and it's  probably gonna be the last time I actually the  sea lightning connection on iPhone next year with  most likely we're going to see USBC but there is  no headphone jack and it hasn't been one since the  iPhone 7 so it's been a bit of a while now since  we've had that then they have stereo speakers the  stereo speakers on both these phones are basically  identical there's no difference there and they  do give out a lot of sound and good quality  sound then we have 5G capability and both these  iPhones have an upgrade to 5G capabilities here  they've got a new 10 gigabit modem inside them  provided by Snapdragon so as long as the cellular  towers can support it and as long as you've got a  good range with that you should be able to get up  to 10 gigabytes of speeds if you can connect to  them then we've got Bluetooth capability both the  iPhone's got an upgrade this year from Bluetooth  5.0 went out on Bluetooth 5.3 and then for cameras  this is where things do change quite a bit between  both the phones and you can even see this by the  look of the pictures so starting with the iPhone  14 plus we have a 12 megapixel wide camera a 12  megapixel Ultra wide camera and they can record  up to 4K video both of these lenses and sensors  do actually capture more light into these sensors  since the the iPhone 13 so that's really good to  hear that so the quality is better and also the  sensors have been readjusted to basically capture  pictures a bit more more smarter this year but  the iPhone 14 pro Max is the crown jewel of  photography for iPhones so we have a brand new  48 megapixel wide camera and it also has pixel  binning built into it so if you just take some  low light photos your photos will actually come  out quite bright still and then also we have  a 12 megapixel Ultra wide and the 12 megapixel  telephoto as well and these have been upgraded  too they've been modified to let an even more  light they can record up to 4K video and it also  does have that lidar sensor that was introduced  with the iPhone 12 Pro Models but for the actual  camera features the iPhone 14 pro Max this time  has quad tone 15 times digital Zoom it also has a  two times and three times optical zoom this time  and you have the standard one times on the sort of  Y camera and then on the ultra wide you also have  that 0.5 so there's sort of four sort of built-in  zoom capabilities you've got night mode deep  Fusion smart hdr3 and then you've also got Apple  Pro raw apple Pro res what's exclusive to the pro  models of the iPhones and you also this time get  30 frames per second cinematic whereas the iPhone  14 plus you do get quad tone but you only get up  to five times digital Zoom inside it you do get  night mode deep Fusion smart hdr3 and you also get  that new 30 times frames per second cinematic but  you won't get any other extra features and you  can't use features like apple Pro raw or apple  Pro res inside it but switching the phones around  the selfie camera both of these phones have an  upgrade this year we've actually got an upgrade to  a 12 megapixel it's a new one with a 1.9 aperture  sensor and lens and you can record up to 4K video  and for the first time ever on an iPhone on the  front camera you've also got autofocus on both  of these phones so really the selfie camera is  identical for both of these new iPhone 14s for  price wise though there is a difference here  even though both the phones are exactly the same  size and they're 6.7 inch display the iPhone 14  pro Max starts at 1099 US dollars but I do know  in other countries it is more than that and the  same with the iPhone 14 plus it's 899 US dollars  in America but in other countries it is starting  out a little bit more so do check out how much  it is in your country but the main difference is  both these models do have around the same sort  of Gap as you can see here what is around about  200 between them and it's going to be be that in  all your other country's sort of currencies it's  going to be about the same sort of difference but  you are getting a bit more of a better phone with  the 14 pro Max over the 14 plus and this is on the  standard base 128 gigabyte model for colors though  wise would the 14 pro Max you get four colors and  the 14 plus you get five colors on the 14 pro Max  we've got silver space black gold and that brand  new Deep Purple that you can see here and then  on the iPhone 14 plus we've got midnight Starlight  product red blue and we've also got the new purple  what you can see here too so with that in mind  what iPhone model will you be buying so as you  can see there are lots of differences just like  I mentioned at the beginning of the video we do  have that a15 chipset what's inside the iPhone  14 plus the same we got inside of the iPhone 13  Pro Max that we've got here but the iPhone 14 pro  Max does have that Dynamic Island for example has  a better Pro motion display and also has a triple  camera setup including that 48 megapixel sensor  inside so like I said I think to be honest there  they are very very similar maybe in size but what  you're going to actually use the iPhone 4 it does  make a big difference and especially in that cost  as well but love to know in the comments below of  what iPhone you are possibly going to be buying  this year if you're going to be getting a new one  or maybe in the future what's going to be your  next model let me know in the comments below and  at the same time guys it's time to wrap up this  video so if you have enjoyed watching it please  do press the like button

o622UWxqF90,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,wow why has nobody mentioned this yet wejust got a bunch of new iPhones buttoday we're gonna be focusing on thebrand new 14 pro Max and comparing tothe 13 Pro Max and cover all of thedifferences that the early reviewersdidn't talk about such as the displaydifferences and dimming the speakerdifferences graphics performance andthrottling as well as the always-ondisplay the new Dynamic Island and muchmore now what I'm really curious aboutis the new space black color that wehave right here people have been kind ofcomplaining online that it's not darkenough and our 13 Pro Max is thegraphite color so we are going to seehow much of a difference it makes andfirst impressions in this lighting mygoodness it looks almost identicalevidence I don't know what it looks likefor you therelet's pull it out man online and somephotos it looked a lot different uh okayright here it looks darker right herelooks identical you know what I'm kindof disappointed now looking at the frameyes the space black one is a lot darkerpretty much at every angle so that's apositive the camera bump does lookdarker and the rings around the lensesare pure black so overall it is a darkeraesthetic now one thing you probablynotice is just how big that camera bumpis it seems like it's getting largerevery year and people complained aboutthe 13 wobbling a lot which itdefinitely did now the 14 let's checkthis one out oh my goodness look at howmuch that moves right there that iscrazy that's because these things stickout a ton because of the new largersensors that require larger lenses andthe cameras are supposed to have gottena lot better this year now we always dothis comparison with the past twogenerations to see how much of anupgrade is it really so if you guys wantto see that it's super informative wecover all of the details make sure sureyou guys click that subscribe buttondown below and with that I want to thankyou guys for 1 million subscribers forall of your support uh for VadimAngelica and I running this channel wegreatly appreciate it it's been an honorto finally receive this plaque andsubscribe if you guys want to help usreach our new goal and continue to growthe power button has been moved down alittle bit this year which is great forreachability and then I also notice thatthe 5G antenna is quite a bit largerthis year so I'm really curious if theydid put in a new 5G chip it looks likewe are going to have to do a 5G speedtest later in this video but on theother side it looks like the volumeswitches actually were raised a bitwhich is weird and the same thing withour mute switch with that you probablyalso noticed that we have no more Simslots that's because the four teams inthe US are all esim and some peopleactually did not buy an iPhone 14because of this they had to buy a 13 Probecause they carry it doesn't support itso that's a bummer now unfortunatelyApple did not give us USB type c so weare still stuck with lighting but on theplus side you don't actually have to useit with moft SNAP stand power set nowI've been buying moth products for yearswe've been recommending them and thispower bank has some really uniquefeatures first off it uses USB type-cand they put the port on the side whichmeans you can plug it in while you'reusing the stand and it charges both thebattery and your phone while otherdevices wouldn't allow you to do thisnow with that you can have it standinghorizontally if you're watching videosnow this is designed for ultimatemodularity so I could take my phone offand the stand separates as well so Icould be charging my earpods while usingthe stand separately to watch videos andof course this is not only a stand it isby far my favorite wallet so holds threecards at the same time this set worksgreat as a a bedside charger when youcome home and when you're ready to goout you can choose and have ultimateversatility than what you need if it'sjust the wallet for today or if you wantthe extra power with the power bank andthen pop on your wallet with that thebattery has a strong magnetic hold butif you get moth's snap case this thinghas absolutely insane magnets personallyI really love how Sleek this battery isand the fact that it has this veganleather so it has a really nice look andfeel to it go ahead and check it out onour partner moff's website using thelinks in the video description and Nowsetting this thing up we have face IDlet's get started and look at that rightthere we already have the dynamic Islandanimation that looks super cool now thebezels did get slightly Slimmer but it'snot as big of a difference as I expectedbut that Notch switching over to thedynamic Island definitely looks cleanerand more minimal than having it stickout there now with that that speakerGrille it also is three times smallerit's barely noticeable next to the framethere and let's go ahead and check outthat Dynamic Island and everything youcould do of course the notch just getsin the way where now this is actually alegitimate feature let's start thistimer and then I'm going to close thisDown Bam right there that Dynamic Islandgot larger I see the time at all timeswhich is wonderful I can press and holdand then bam I have some controls rightthere let's open up Apple music we'replaying this song and I'm gonna swipe upbam it just added that right in split itup to the pill and the cutout I'm gonnapress and hold here I see the song haveall my controls and then at the sametime I could still access my timer bamit disappeared and now we're playing thesong and it's crazy how fluid everythingis the animations are top notch I meanuh top Island and pretty much everybodyelse agrees that this is just so cooltaking a downside and making it afeature with that we also have somemajor display differences that peopledidn't talk about but first I'm curiousabout the speakers do they get anybetter or worse because of the ultraslim earpiece speaker let's go ahead andtake a listen[Music][Music]all right wow why has nobody mentionedthis yet that was incredible not only isit louder dramatically louder everythingsounds better I actually listened to itside by side going back and forth andthinking maybe they had to make the baseworse to make the highs have a lot moreclarity no it sounds better maybe themyths know the mid sound better and thehighs they have a lot more clarity andit's not just extra sharpness theyactually sound softer than with a 13 ProMax but with more clarity there's noneof that weird kind of like uh statickyhigh pitched in the highs in order tomake them louder it's incredible thewhole Sound Stage sounds better soundsmore dynamic between the differentinstruments I was not expecting this atall so you know what let me open up asuper tough track this is a rock trackwith a ton of different instruments andvocals so let's take a listen[Applause]now we neverneverletdang guys I don't know how much of ityou can hear through our mic throughYouTube compression but the separationis a lot better there's another guitarthat you can hear which gets just mushedtogether with everything on the olderiPhone the vocals stand out more uh thedrums I mean this is a big bigImprovement so if you like watchingmovies listening music on your phonethat's a nice upgrade getting back tothe displays the first thing I noticedis that the 14 pro Max has a warmerdisplay both a true tone on and withthat the viewing angles are quite a bitbetter as well so it's a whole new OLEDpanel maxing out the manual brightnesson both they look very close maybeslightly brighter on the 14 pro Max nowgoing outside and enabling autobrightness for that 2000 Peak that Appleadvertise we definitely saw it kick upand get much brighter than the 13 ProMax the results were noticeable and thatis going to be really nice when you'reoutside in the sun it's gonna really popnow coming inside again and checking outHDR Apple says can hit 1600 nits nowinstead of the 13 Pro Max's previous1200 so let's go ahead and take a lookright out of the gate I'm seeing alittle bit more brightness with the 14pro Max and a little bit more contrastand saturation now the difference isn'thuge you would think from 1200 to 1600would be massive maybe some of thesebrights aren't that bright that's what'srequired uh but overall you definitelydo see it and combined with the outdoorbrightness coming up there you go that'spopping a little bit more it definitelyis a nice Improvement in the screen andthat also leads us right into the otheramazing feature that really stands outthe new always on display with the 14Pros as soon as you shut it off it dimsdown the color tones remain but it getsa lot dimmer instead of shutting offthat is so nice and their implementationof this always on display is much betterthan the competition and now let's getinto performance one thing that nobodyreally talks about is the disc speedI'm gonna go ahead and run this wow thatis really fast now on the right speedthe difference is only 13 with the sameuh storages but the read is 70 percentfaster and that is when this phone wasuh without the storage filled up so thatis a pretty dramatic difference and wealso tested uh different capacitiesthere's no difference between 256 and512 which is also great so you'redefinitely getting faster storage as faras CPU performance the 14 Pros are theonly ones that get the new a16 whereasthe 14s get the processor that's in the13 pro and pro Max so looking at theactual specs here uh we have a slightlyhigher frequency but our Ram stayed thesame let's go ahead and run our CPU testand see how much faster it is maybe theram being faster is going to make adifference all right we have our resultsand it's okay we have 13 faster as faras single core and 12 faster as far asmulti-core score now both these arescoring slightly less than what we'veseen before but you know that's anincremental upgrade of course it's foran animator so probably we have someadvantages as far as battery life but Ihave another thing to show you guys thatnobody has shown you yet none of thereviewers talked about this this is our14 pro not the pro Max and I rangeekbench here as well and this is crazywe have a score of4844 in terms of multi-core practicallyidentical as the 13 Pro Max and the 13Pro meaning if you are gonna buy thisregular size 14 pro the performance isnot much better at all and if you wantthe full performance you have to get thepro Max because apple is just giving ithigher clock speeds because of itsbetter cooling capability and largerchassis Apple didn't mention it theyshould have reviewers didn't mention itand here you go at maxc we're showingthis off and now let's go ahead andcheck out the graphics performance withour compute Benchmark and here it is wehave a difference of seven percent soeven worse than on the CPU side I missedthe days when we were having these 40jumps these massive ones so this isbarely any different now how did theregular 14 pro hold up man look at thatthe score is actually higher than the 14pro Max so unlike the CPU Apple's notcapping the performance of the graphicsthey want to make sure that if you'regaming you still get good performance sothat is a positive but with that are wegonna have to be dealing with the screendimming issues that we had with the 13slet's go ahead and check it out I haveantutu opened up right here and we gotthe phone set bright so we're gonna goahead and start running this is a testthat really pushes the phones and ittests out the graphics performance andwe definitely got dimming before ofcourse in other regular games we gotdimming and if you're using mobilecellular data as well it was just veryfrustrating in the past oh right thereyou guys see the iPhone 13 dimming rightaway at the start right there at the endof the first test you guys see that the14 pro is definitely brighter the testsare loading up faster because of thatstorage speed oh did you guys see thatoh no Vadim do you saw that dim ah comeon Apple put in new thermal graphitematerial and now okay the 13 just dimmedeven more I mean this is a tough testbut I did not expect the 14 pro to dimthat fast I was hoping it with dim atall this is one of our biggestannoyances with the previous ones yeahand it looks like it has not been fixedat least here when it's loading up thenext test the 14 pro Max is definitelybrighter but let's see what keepshappening here in this next test I meanone thing I'm noticing is that the 14pro Max is much smoother and we stillhave some drop frames it's a tough testbut this one maybe it's slowing downbecause of the heat you guys see thebrightness differences the 14 pro Max isdefinitely brighter right now I thinkwhat's happening is that the 13 Pro Maxkeeps dimming more and more so while the14 pro Max is staying a bit moreconsistent busting out the thermalcamera I want to see the heatdifferences we definitely have a biggerhot spot on the 14 pro Max at 4142degrees Celsius the 13 Pro Max also sametemperatures just less spread which thatis actually a good thing that the 14 proMax has taken at heat and spreading itout instead of keeping it concentratedwhere it's going to slow down theperformance of the graphics and andcaused the screen to dim more and hereyou see yes this does Dim when that isunfortunate it sucks it's not fixed butit is a lot better so if you guys wantto see a more in-depth gaming test havea team test out both with a variety ofgames for a longer period of time makesure you guys click that subscribebutton down below and here are thescores overall we have a difference of13 as far as a CPU we have a 15difference so it's actually bigger thanwe had in geekbench GPU has a fivepercent difference that's a little bitsmaller that might be because both ofthem did have to slow down uh theirGraphics we had the screen dimmingkicking in on both memory we have a bigdifference we showed that off previouslyand the ux the you the smoothness uh foryour scrolling all that kind of stuffnot much of a difference overall so whatwe did find is that yes it does stilldim it does suck that that it does butit's not as big of an issue as we hadpreviously and now let's go ahead andtest out out the 5G speeds I swapped outthat space black one for my gold becauseI have the Sim enabled and then we'regoing across two sims uh let's open thisup and see what we get now initially itlooks like we're getting a worse barthan the older 13 Pro Max here theresults I ran these separately and itlooks like as far as download we haveslightly faster but as far as upload itis quite a bit slower almost half thespeed now we are indoors in a concretebuilding with 5G enabled the pars arevery low but the download speeds arevery good now what I want to do is gointo the settings and switch over to LTEinstead of 5G on not everybody has 5Gand let's see what we get dang guys lookat that we have 18.8 download and 2 forupload compared to 90 and almost eightso if you don't have 5G and you're ininside of a building the new iPhone 14pro antenna and cellular chip does a waybetter job with the same amount of Ltebars and now let's go ahead and headoutside I tested them separately to makesure it's fair and look we have a 125download on the 13 Pro compared to 245.that's a huge difference as far as theupload we have 30 compared to 46. nowthe upload is way better than it wasinside but the download is actuallyslower which is quite odd so I justwonder if you're inside and you have nosignal maybe the antenna puts a boostyou know use a lot more power butoutside doesn't need to and justoptimizing for Speed so overall yes the14 pro Max does have much fastercellular speeds and now let's talk aboutthe cameras probably one of the biggestreasons why people are going to beupgrading on the front we finally have acamera that has autofocus so let's seeif there's a difference I'm going tobring this closer than normal take ashot you guys go ahead and let me knowwhat you think to me it definitely lookssharper with the new one I also see adifference in HDR we have a lot more popin the highlights so that definitelylooks nicer now with the rear cameras wehave that 48 megapixel camera that willover sample to 12 megapixels so let mego outside and I'm going to take acouple shots I'll also get one with athree times telephoto that hasn'tchanged but I want to know how much of adifference does software make so here'sour first shot with the wide camera thisis just out of the box shooting I wantto see do we see any more detail andhonestly I don't really see it thisone's actually a little bit darker uhmight have a little bit more compressionnoise here in the actual building let'sgo over to the trees honestly I thinkthe old shot looks better in thisperfect kind of lighting scenario with alot of HDR now I went into the settingsto enable Pro raw because I want to testout the full 48 megapixel and itactually gives you the option to downsample those files but this is the fullhuge file right here let's go ahead andzoom into this water tower and mygoodness I mean look at that detaileddifference we have this waxy kind ofwashed out mess compared to all of thatdetail right there yeah if you want themost detail if you're gonna be croppingin you want to enable that now I alsotook a 15x and right in the gate youcan't tell that much of a difference butif we crop in it's definitely betterwith the new processing on the 14 prohere's a portrait shot with the new 2xcrop mode from the main sensor comparedto the full size shot it's definitelynice to have that extra reach but notpunch in too much where before you wouldhave to crop in on the regular shot orget closer and take a shot like thisthat's distorted now of course we alsohave video differences we have the ultrawide the low light light modes so we aregoing to be doing a detailed comparisonwhere I'm going to test out the 14 proMax 13 Pro Max in 12 Pro Max and showyou all of the differences in photo andvideo so you guys can see for yourselvesif it's worth upgrading if you guys wantto see that click that subscribe

Y4hZQizkDPg,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,So we've just had apples far out of them where  we've just seen the brand new iPhone 14 models  and in this video today I want to do an iPhone  13 Pro Max versus the iPhone 14 pro max review  of specs and show you what the difference is of  what you'll be getting with the iPhone 14 pro Max  over the likes of say the iPhone 13 Pro Max and  without further Ado let's get started so this year  we do have some big changes with the iPhone 14 pro  Max over the iPhone 13 Pro Max so on the left we  have the iPhone 13 Pro Max and on the right we  have the iPhone 14 pro Max so let's start this  comparison to start with we have the display types  the display type has not changed now for a good  few Generations we have an OLED display for both  the 13 Pro Max and also the 14 pro Max no changes  there whatsoever however the OLED display on the  14 pro Max is a lot brighter and it will output  up to 2 000 nits which absolutely incredible and  whereas the iPhone 13 Pro Max I believe could only  go up to 1500 nits so you will definitely get a  brighter display on the iPhone 14 pro Max next  of all we actually got the screen sizes being  that the iPhone 12 Pro Max all the way to the  14 pro Max are basically being the same model  design there's no change here on screen sign  whatsoever however the Apple have claimed that the  actual edge to edge display is actually a little  bit smaller on the 14 pro Max but the overall size  of the actual screen hasn't changed at all so not  quite sure how Apple have actually accomplished  this but it is a 6.68 inch on both of these models  the screen resolution on this there are 16x9 on  both and then obviously that resolution is 2778  by 1484 on both of the models completely identical  moving on though for pixels per inch again it's  exactly the same 450 a pixels per Edge or PPI and  again that is really really super crystal clear  on both of these iPhones next of all we do have a  display refresh rate and both of these iPhones now  have the pro motion display however the iPhone  14 pro Max actually now goes down to one Hertz  to 120 hertz whereas the iPhone 13 Pro Max goes  down to 10 Hertz and all the way up to 120 hertz  after this we have the actual display protection  and so we have the ceramic shield on both of  these iPhones or gives our overall protections  really really strong like Gorilla Glass the top  gorilla grass out there so yeah you shouldn't  really get any sort of Smash screens you might  get the occasional little scratch on the phone  but generally the screen is really really tough  then after this the actual processor and CPU and  things have changed here so with the iPhone 13  Pro Max we've got the a15 bionic chipset on that  and that was one that made on a five nanometer  die and that consisted of four efficiency cores  two performance cores and also at the same time  has a 5 Core GPU but the a16 bionic is actually  made on a four nanometer process so this basically  means transitions are smaller the chip is actually  more efficient and because of this they managed  to basically keep the same amount of cores so  again this is the same sort of four efficiency  core two performance cores and also we have the  five GPU cores but generally speaking this actual  a16 chipset is more powerful yet more efficient  than we got with the a15 bionic then we actually  got the ram amounts and they are actually six  gigabytes of RAM on both of these iPhones but  there is a big difference here the iPhone 13  Pro Max uses the older lpddr4xram whereas the  iPhone 14 pro Max uses the brand new LP ddr5 Ram  instead then we've got storage amounts there's no  differences here it starts at 128 gigabytes and  goes all the way up to one terabytes and this is  for both the iPhones and good old sort of iPhone  stands there is no expansional storage there's  only abilities to store things in the cloud for  example next we have the operating system now both  of these iPhones do run on iOS 16. however the  14 pro Max uses more iOS 16 features so it's got  more features for example it's got that always on  display and the main reason behind that is because  it can go down to one Hertz refresh rate now out  and also it's got car crash detection for example  and also it has the ability to do notification  using that Dynamic Island that we have seen as  well then we have the battery size and don't be  thrown off by this the iPhone 13 Pro Max has a  4 352 milliamp battery whereas the iPhone 14  pro Max actually has a 4 323 milliamp battery  what is 0.6 smaller but you've got to remember  we have the a16 chipset inside the 14 pro Max  what's even more efficient than the a15 chipset  and it was definitely going to be more than 0.6  more efficient it's probably gonna be more like  around about eight to ten percent more efficient  so technically speaking the iPhone 14 pro Max  will give you longer battery life even though  the battery is ever so slightly smaller than  what we've got inside the iPhone 13 Pro Max  then we have the actual wired and wireless  charging nothing really has changed here at all we  still have the lightning port and this is 20 watts  and we also can have wireless magsafe charging  what again is 15 watts there is no difference here  in charging abilities and charging speeds then the  actual weight the iPhone 13 Pro Max comes in at  240 grams and then the actual iPhone 14 pro Max  even though it has bigger lenses inside a bigger  sensor and the camera is a little bit bigger as  well funny enough it actually weighs exactly  the same as the iPhone 13 Pro Max at 240 grams  then after that we've got water resistance water  resistance is exactly the same on both of these  phones that ip68 and this allows your iPhone 13  Pro Max or the 14 pro Max to go up to six meters  in Clear Water up to 30 minutes being rescued  without sort of any sort of permanent damage  going onto the actual iPhone him ports wise this  year we've got the iPhone's normal lightning port  and this is the same across both the iPhones no  difference there and again there is no headphone  jack that has gone now completely and that's why  we have those new airpods as well stereo speakers  are available on both of these iPhones the actual  speakers should be around about the same there's  no differences this time and then we've got 5G  on both of these iPhones and we do have mm wave  on the iPhone 13 Pro Max but we also on the iPhone  4 team Promax have a brand new 10 gigabyte modem  inside it so if the actual antennas or the actual  cellular towers allow this to happen you should  even get a faster 5G connection where that is  available for Bluetooth the technology hasn't  changed it's Bluetooth 5.0 for both the iPhone  13 Pro Max and the 14 pro Max and then the rear  cameras this is where things have changed we do  have still a triple lens camera setup but on the  iPhone 13 Pro Max we have 12 megapixel sensors  on the wide ultrawide and the telephoto and this  allows us up to record up to 4K video and we  also have the lidar but we do have that brand  new larger sensor on the iPhone 14 pro Max with  a wide sensor or the lens what's 48 megapixel now  but we also do have a refreshed 12 megapixel in  the ultra wide and the telephoto what lets an even  more light and we can also do 4K video recording  on this and it also has that lidar sensor too then  for actual rear camera features most of these are  exactly the same where we can do our digital zoom  and things like this however the optical zoom on  the actual iPhone 14 pro Max you do actually have  the ability now to do two times and three times  optical zoom and also the Cinematic mode now on  the 14 pro Max is 30 frames per second everything  else like night mode deep Fusion Smart hdr3 Apple  Pro or apple Pro rest is available on both of  these iPhones the selfie camera has also changed  a little bit as well we actually have a much more  sharper camera on the actual iPhone 14 pro Max it  is still a 12 megapixel one the aperture is better  but it also allows you to auto focus for the first  time on a selfie camera on the single lens on the  front of an iPhone last of all we've got the price  on the iPhones now the iPhone 13 Pro Max is no  longer available to buy from Apple direct but  other people out there are still selling at 1099  US dollars or sometimes you can get it at a sale  price and that is a good deal if you can guess  it cheaper but because Apple has stopped selling  this I do have to display it as 1099 US Dollars  and the iPhone 14 pro Max has actually come out  at the exact same price a year later at 1099 US  dollars then next of all we do actually have the  colors now the colors again have changed we do  have on the iPhone 13 Pro Max we have the silver  graphite gold and Sierra blue and we've got four  colors for the 14 pro Max and again that is silver  we have a space black with a little bit different  to the graphite we have gold again and we also do  have that brand new Deep Purple what you've seen  here in the sort of demo of these specs here  so with that in mind what iPhone model will  you be buying so as you can see there's lots  of enhancements on the iPhone 14 pro Max over like  we've got on the iPhone 13 Pro Max we have those  better camera lenses now and the bigger sensor we  also have that brand new display on the front as  well and there's loads of other features however  the iPhone 13 Pro Max is still a fantastic phone  and if you can get a really good deal on it I'd  still recommend getting yourself one right now  however for everybody else if you do want to get  yourself an iPhone 14 pro Max I do really hope  that this video has helped you out and on that  note guys it's time to wrap up this video so if  you have enjoyed watching it please do press  the like button and also at the same time

pTCgWVjB6UE,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,[Music]foreignat you from a hotel room in CupertinoCalifornia because today was Apple'sSeptember event and this is your firstlook your Hands-On and your impressionsand honest thoughts and everything youneed to know about the iPhone 14 lineupand while the phones do look prettysimilar to last year there is a lot ofinteresting stuff kind of tucked in andI've got a lot of thoughts on it but asyou might know the September event it isthe iPhones and iPhone accessories andso we did get new airpods and a new setof watches including a new Apple watchUltra that I also got Hands-On time withthat'll be a separate video I'll link upa little like button so you can check itout when it's live or hopefully you'realready subscribed here withnotifications turned on in which caseyou'll see it right away but that'sgoing to be a different video but fornow our new iPhones in 2022 we have theiPhone 14 and 14 plus and then theiPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max rip to themini iPhone you had a good run so thenew Baseline iPhones as you can imagineare pretty similar it's just one is muchbigger than the other one so the iPhone14 and 14 Plus have 6.1 inch and 6.7inch displays respectively my predictionon waveform was that all the priceswould stay the same and that turned outto be correct so the iPhone 14 is 7.99and the bigger 14 plus is 8.99 andreally what you'll notice is these twophones look very similar to last yearwith some some bumps and refinementshere and there of course but they bothhave the same a15 bionic chip as lastyear the same design the same notch onthe outside I'm actually convinced thata case that fits the iPhone 13 will fitthe iPhone 14 but the green is gone andthere is a new light blue that matchesmy shirt extremely well but there'sthree main things that are new here thedisplay the cameras andconnectivity if that makes sense so theconnectivity is the quirkiest one as youcan imagine uh you know how iPhonesforever have always had a little SIMcard tray on the side well in the USstarting with the iPhone 14 they willnot have SIM card trays anymore theywill be moving entirely to esimelectronic Sim which is fine I guess Imean they work well it's typically veryeasy to upgrade phones or even swapbetween carriers but I have to wondernaturally if this is also going to actas a little bit of an extra wall in theWalled Garden because now how hard is itgoing to be to switch from an iPhoneto a non-iphone just something to thinkabout but anyway the iPhone 14's alsogot satellite connectivity for SOS andthis is actually really impressive so inareas where you don't have any CellularConnection but you still need to send amessage you will be able to talk tosatellites to still get a message sentso now satellite connectivity isnotoriously pretty difficult you'd needa big radio or at least something withlarge external antennas and you need anunobstructed view of the sky and youhave to point it directly at a satelliteI mean you've probably seen what astarlink dish looks like so now Apple'sbuilt this sensitivity into the iPhone14s antennas and they've actually builta piece of UI in where it'll actuallyhelp you point directly at a satelliteand it will help you send that emergencymessage it'll actually package it upinto a smaller format and within 30seconds to one or two minutes it cansend a message even when you have nocellular connectivity it's an edge casehopefully you'll never have to use itbut that is pretty cool that it can getit doneum and the details where it will becoming to the US and Canada launchinglater this year and it will be free fortwo years and then that's all we kind ofknow but as far as things you'llactually use every day the displays arethe same size and resolutions as beforebut they do get a bit brighter now 1200nits Max for HDR content everything elseis the same and then there is a newcamera system a larger 12 megapixel mainsensor with sensor shift stabilization awider F 1.5 aperture for better photosand hopefully better sensitivity and lowlight and there is a new 12 megapixelselfie camera on the front withautofocus plus they've introduced thiswhole new photonic engine again theyname everything but really that's just abetter image processing pipeline fromend to end which should improve acrossthe board low light sensitivity andnighttime photos things like thatthere's also a new action mode featurein the camera that does much moredramatic stabilization on super shakyvideos I definitely got to try this outfor myself it seems like it works bestwith certain types of shots like theones they use in their demos but we'llsee basically the way I see it is thesenew iPhone 14s and 14 pluses areessentially an iPhone 13 Pro one yearlater minus the telephoto camera andminus the promotion OLED dressed inaluminum like it's a very familiar phoneI guess on the plus side pun intendedhaving a larger iPhone with a 1080p 60hzdisplay means they can promise that thiswill be the best battery life ever in aniPhone this plus and I'm pretty surethis plus is going to be a hit if I knowanything about regular people's phonebuying decisions I think spending anextra 100 bucks for a way bigger screenis a no-brainer so that's 7.99 for theiPhone 14 and 8.99 for the 14 plus whichactually comes out a month later inOctober for some reason but then we gotthe iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max whichhave a little bit more going on it'sstill got all the new stuff from the 14and 14 plus that I just talked aboutsatellite connectivity uh action mode inthe camera it's even the same two sizesagain 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches butthere are three new things here andthose are a new a16 bionic chip and aneven bigger camera upgrade and then thisthing called Dynamic Islandwe'll get to it so the a16 bionic chipinside is even more powerful and moreefficient as you can imagine it's now asix core chip built on a four nanometerprocess they're quoting forty percentbetter than the competition sweet andthere's also actually a slight displayupgrade as well this is up to 2 000 nitsMax brightness Outdoors which is classleading and the pro iPhones now finallyfinally have an always-on display so youcan see still the time and if you havenotifications and even updated info onyour widgets while your phone is lockedand just sitting around on a table orcharging that I like a lot but the bigupgrades like I said are going to be thecamera and the cutout at the top okay sothe camera system is all new and it isbigger like you can tell just by lookingat it that everything in here is biggerit protrudes more off the back of thephone but yeah technically speaking thisis the first time in about a decade thatwe're actually getting a megapixel bumpthis is a new 48 megapixel main camerasensor on the 14 Pros so it's stillgoing to bend down to 12 megapixels fornormal shots you'll get 12 megapixelimages out of it but you'll hopefully beable to reap the benefits of higherdetail better low light sensitivity froma bigger sensor but also if you want toshoot 48 megapixel photos you can youjust gotta shoot Pro raw then you'll get48 megapixel shots and then they alsoadded a new 2x button into the camera UIwhich might not seem like a big deal butthat turns out to just be an exact cropusing the middle 12 megapixels of thesensor itself so you can hit that 2xbutton to zoom in basically with Opticalquality which is much better than beforeplus you still have the further 3xtelephoto lens the Sun is setting realhardcore down here so sorry if I startto look orange but I'm definitelylooking forward to test out thesecameras I've already been shooting a lotwith the iPhone 13 Pro on the newautofocus Channel you might have seenthat if you've subscribe you've noticedI've been experimenting with the camerasover there but uh it'll be interestingto see if we notice the difference bystarting to shoot those with an iPhone14 pro and also comparing it to thingslike the pixel and the s22 Ultras of theworld but then let's talk about thisDynamic Island thing so okay I kid younot when they first announced this thatthey were going to name it a dynamicIsland literally the entire theater likeaudibly laughed there was a laughter outloud from the crowdum and I thought it was hilarious likewhy would they name the pill but thenthey explained itand The more I've used it and The moreI've actually played with it andunderstood it since makes a lot of senseand I actually really like it sobasically What's Happening Here isApple's shrunk down all the selfiecamera and the parts of the face IDsystem down by about 30 and so they'llfit in this pill-shaped cutout in thetop of the screen fine if they'd stoppedhere that would be an incredibly minorupdate I mean it's literally justaesthetic not worth mentioning since wesee selfie cutouts all the time foryears now but then they went a stepfurther with it so since it's an OLEDand you can turn off any pixels toappear pitch black they decided to playwith extending the edges of the pillwith more UI so if you have ongoingnotifications or live actions stuff likemusic playing or timers in thebackground or an Uber notification orwhatever those will show up and it hasthis nice little animation to extend andshrink and move around the cutout and itworks really really well so then you cantap on the icon and to open that app andtake action or you can actually holddown to surface extra information forwhat's happening which basically justlooks like the widget that would be inyour notifications just without havingto pull down your notifications this iscool it's pretty cool it works rightaway with a bunch of the stock uh Appleapps Apple Maps the timer the voicemailsand all that stuff but they say it willalso work with third-party apps now thiswill be up to them how fast they want toimplement it fingers crossed that myfavorite apps like Spotify and thingslike that get on it quickly we'll seebut yeah this immediately takes the thewhole pill cut out thing to a new levelthe more I played around with it themore I was impressed I was trying itwith multiple background activitieshappening at the same time and basicallywhat happens is it would show both solet's say if you have a timer and Mapsnavigation and music playing allhappening in the background the dynamicIsland would low-key turn into like alittle multitasking UI and let youquickly switch between these ongoingthings and it was already very intuitiveit also just seems to be pretty generousabout where you're tapping so obviouslyif you tap exactly on just the cameracutout itself well nothing will happenbecause those aren't actual pixels it'sjust the camera cutout but your fingeris big enough that it naturally hitssome of the pixels around the top andthe bottom of the cutout so it stillknows to respond pretty much anytime youjust tap the black bar and there's alsosome active pixels in between you cankind of see them at just the right angleso if you touch in there it stillresponds it's really good I think a lotof people are gonna really love this youremember back in the day when there waslike all these really friendly uhwallpapers that would take advantage oflike a whole punch cut out that would goviral because it's like oh that's areally thoughtful way of hiding a holein the screen this is just like a a NextLevel upgrade moving version of thatit's it's really thoughtful playfulfriendly and intuitive so it's just it'sjust a level up version of that so evenif the cutout looks a little worsesometimes when when playing full screenvideos or playing games I feel like itkind of makes up for it by being souseful so often also I hope this is thelast time I ever have to say the worddynamic Island out loud it's stupid thatthey had to name it but that's how applerolls so they named it but yeah that'sthat's the new Pro phones also there'sthis new purple color kind of a dulllavender type of purple but again sameprices as last year too 9.99 and 10.99starting and they go up to one terabytethere's not a lot of crazy InnovativeHardware design going on here nothing'sfolding in half there's no super fasthigh-end fast charging or wirelesscharging it's just it's just a bunch oflittle refinements again at this pointwe know what the iPhone is Apple knowswhat the iPhone is and they tend to belate on the train to picking up onthings and then doing it in the appleway that's pretty much exactly what'shappening with the cutout and that'swhat the iPhone 14s are also theysneakily left some of the 13s still inthe lineup the 13 Mini and the 13Baseline are still available if you wantthem 5.99 for the 13 mini and 6.99 forthe 13. now I don't have the new boxesyet but I think it's pretty safe toassume that none of the new boxes willhave Chargers in them because theyhaven't for years now and that's wherethe sponsor of this video comes inAnchor you've heard of them so they'vegot these two things that pair perfectlywith the new iPhones the new Anker Nano3 and the new 541 cable so the nano3charges with gallium nitride whichallows it to be way smaller this littlebrick is a 30 watt charger which is goodfor the iPhone or the iPad or the watchor even the MacBook Air but it'sliterally 70 smaller than Apple's 30watt brick and the USBC to lightningcable is the first I've seen to usebio-based materials including sugar caneand corn but it still feels exactly likea good high quality cable because it isone it's built to withstand 20 000 bendsthere's a three or six foot version andthey both come in five colors includingthis lilac purple you can check them outat the a link below and pick up your ownbut that's been it for this Hands-On andthe first look at the new lineup let meknow what you think of the new iPhoneshonestly I think I think regular peopleare gonna love the dynamic Island butlet me know what your thoughts are and Ialso believe that the plus is going tobe a hit but I'll see in the commentsbelow what you guys are feeling and alsoof course check out the other videoswhen they come out link below when Italk about the watch okay that's been itthanks for watching catch you guys laterthank you[Music]
v94jRN2FhGo,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,[Music]hey what's up mkhd here okay i'vealready reviewed the iphone 14 pro and14 pro max you can watch those at thelink below the like button the dynamicisland the camera upgradeall that the bottom line is that is afar more interesting set of phones thathas a few things that are actually newto the iphone which is kind of cool theiphone 14 on the other hand uh not somuch not so much this is almost theexact same phone as last year so do youremember those s updates we used to getlike we'd have the iphone 5 and then theiphone 5s and then s for speed becauseit was the same phone but just fasterthis phone is even less of an updatethan those s upgrades used to be and sothat's what i want to talk about in thisreview is this new repackaging strategything that apple's been doing especiallymore lately with a bunch of theirproducts so this year we do get aniphone 14 and an iphone 14 plus this 14is out now and the 14 plus is coming outin a month in october it's basically thesame thing just bigger 6.1 inches here6.7 inches there and so many things arethe same as last year's phone on theoutside the design is the same theiphone 13 cases literally work with theiphone 14. like this is the new aliabdowl dbrand grip case on the iphone 14it's pretty sweet but then again here ismy iphone 13 from last year andyepfits perfectlybut yeah same squared off sides samebutton placement same camera arrangementsame antennas same speakers etc and thenon the inside it's literally the samechip from last year it's the a15 bionicagain technically a slight bump up withthe extra gpu cores that was in the 13probut i mean yeah last year's chip too nowtechnically you could say these are allthings that i liked about the iphone 13so hey if it ain't broke don't fix itright that's apple but that also meansthat a lot of things that could havestood to improve that could have gottenbetteralso didn't change so it's the samedisplay with the same brightness and thesame 60hz refresh rate in an 800 phone imean it would be so unlike apple but ireally would have loved to have seenlike 90 hertz herebut yeah same storage options samebattery size same charging speeds samelightning port the way i see it it's aniphone 13 again a year later with sometiny improvements matter of fact here isa full comprehensive list of everysingle thing that's technically new okaycrash detectionsatellite connectivity displayresolution e-sim new colors betterthermal design better repairabilitydesignnew primary camera and new selfie camerawell this should be easy so crashdetection is cool it uses some newsensors inside the phone and combines abunch of data from the gps andmicrophones etc to notice if you've beenin a car crash and if you have it'llnotify emergency services without youhaving to do anything it's cool it's anice feature i hope i never have to useit and then if you're in the middle ofnowhere with no cell service and youstill need help the iphone 14 series cannow communicate with satellites in caseof emergency to help you get yourlocation and your needs to someone at adispatch center that's coming to the usand canada in november that's anothernice featurethat i hope i never have to use thedisplay is technically a slightly higherresolution with slightly thinner bezelsbut you will definitely never noticethatand the new lineup in the us is now alsoe-sim only to be fair the setup processand transferring service from myprevious iphone's physical sim wasactually super easy it's like maybe twominutes tops and most other phonescoming out today new also support esimso i'm hoping the transfer process inthe future is also smooth but yeah nophysical sim card tray here in thestates there also is this new blue colorthen again most of you like an extremelyhigh percentage of you have said thatyou use a case on your phone soi wonder how many of those are clearcases and then apple did mention animproved thermal design inside thisphone for the same a15 bionic chip whichcan help performance at the edges ofnormal use cases so like playing a gamefor a really long time or navigatingwith high screen brightness with thephone in your dashboard in your car on ahot sunny day things that might getextra warm have an added layer ofprotection against throttling i thinkthat's something the pro users will caremore about but i definitely won'tcomplain that it's also hereand the better repairability design wasmentioned also near the end of thekeynote it's a little thing but it'sactually pretty surprising from applewhich is that the glass back is now aseparate piece from the rest of theinternals making it easier to replacecool but easily the biggest physicalchange with these new iphones is goingto be the cameras so there's a slightlynew 12 megapixel primary camera theultrawide is exactly the same hardwareand a new 12 megapixel selfie camerawith autofocus now i spent a bunch oftime looking back and forth at picturesi took on the iphone 14 and the iphone13 trying to pinpoint the improvementsit's like a game of spot the differencesand there are some differences but theyare so slight so this new camera isstill 12 megapixels but it is a largersensor so the individual pixels arebigger and should let in more light andthen the max aperture went from f 1.6 tof 1.5in regular daytime lighting there ispretty much no difference like theiphone is perfectly capable of crispdetailed natural looking photos whenthere are no challenges just like everyother 800 phone always has been reallythe only difference i'm seeing is maybecolor temperature the iphone 14 can takesome occasionally cooler photos and it'snoticeable if you have the right colorsin the picturebut here's a shot from the iphone 14 prowith the 48 megapixel pro raw shot forcontext here you can actually see a bitof a difference it's a slightlydifferent focal length but also moreimportantly there's lots more finedetail here and just for fun here's thepixel 6 pro same shot another greatdetailed photo but just looks like adifferent style but as expected most ofthe differences between these that ifound were more on the edge cases ofnormal photography that more challengingor extremelighting situations mostly in low lightand so some of this is enabled by theslightly larger sensor and fasteraperturesome of this is also enabled by the newimage processing pipeline that they'vetweaked and fiddled with that they alsonamed photonic engine you know on stagethey were saying things like 49 betterlow light performance which i'm notexactly sure what's meant by 49 like isit 49 faster shutter speed or 49 lessnoise in low light unclear but as i gothrough the photos i took on both igotta say they're stillremarkably similar okay again i waslooking for the differences in theamount of noise in the shadows ordynamic range but really what i mostlyfound was slight differences in colortemperature you know sometimes one mightbe a little brighter than the otherand sometimes it's really hard to tellthem apart even pixel peeping i evenlooked at shutter speeds which maysometimes reveal that you actually havea faster shutter speed from the biggersensor because it's taking in more lightand while i found that they were nearlythe same for every shot the iphone 14was typically maybe five to ten percentfaster the one thing i did find was thatin the absolute darkest shots in theworst conditions there was sometimes adifference in how much time it wouldrequire to get a night mode exposurelike for this one it took 3 seconds fromthe 13 but 2 seconds from the 14.even though the 13 actually ended upfocusing more correctly and had a bit ofa sharpness advantage in this shotsometimes you just got to get the shot alittle quicker if possible and then thisone from the ultrawide it was a onesecond night mode exposure from the 13but just a regular snap from the 14. soit's the exact same hardware i guessthat's the difference for the photonicengine and image processingeven sothe image is a toss-up like it's alittle more processing happening on theiphone 14 side maybe a little moresharpening a slightly different colorcast but that's it and then on the videofront it's even more similar so theytake basically the same video but theiphone 14 does have a feature calledaction mode that's not coming to the 13sfor some reason even though it feelslike a software feature but it'sbasically a super aggressivestabilization for running around andchasing stuff on top of the alreadypretty good stabilization from theiphone's video and i will say thestabilization part works very wellbut the video itself can be quite noisyalso it seems like in almost everyenvironment it's just asking for morelight all the time like you get thisdialog box that says more light requiredbut it still lets you shoot but thefootage is super grainy and softespecially from the ultra wide that itdefaults to but also like i'm in anincredibly well-lit studio and sometimesit would ask for more light even in herethis is better lit than most people'shomes where you're chasing around ababy or a pet at 100 miles an hour letalone sometimes going outside on acloudy day and it's asking for morelight that's crazy so this may getbetter over time as of right now itshows up less on the iphone 14 pro whichmakes sense because this one has alarger primary sensorbut yeah the stabilization works reallywell it's a software feature you mightuse and then there is the new selfiecamera it is 12 megapixels and hasautofocus for the first time instead ofthe fixed focal distance from before youcan get sharper shots in some lessconventional selfie situations which isgreat um it's not game changinglydifferent i mean it's anotherincremental improvement it can stillstruggle with properly reproducingdarker skin tones which i mentioned inthe 14 pro review here's the same shotfrom the pixel 6 pro which specificallyhas their real tone optimization so youcan see what i mean so at the end of theday what are we left witha super incremental update in the samebody basically as beforeand that's what i want to talk aboutthat they've done a lot more recentlysome might call it the tim cooklogistics touch see that's been theiphone se formulafor years i've talked about it in thosereviews so the first generation iphonese comes out it's basically the body ofan old iphone 5s but with new internalsthen the second generation iphone secomes out it's the body of an iphone 8but with new internals and then thethird generation iphone sc again that wejust got this year again is the body ofan iphone 8 but even newer internalsand there's rumors of the next gen scbeing like the body of an iphone 10rbut the new chipand we even saw that with the macbookpro this year the 13-inch m2 macbook prois the exact same body as the 13-inch m1macbook pro just with better internalsnow it's not exactly some mystery whythey do this there's plenty of reasonsbehind the scenes why these things aregood for apple it reduces riskit reduces cost because now you don'thave to develop as much new stuffand then prices go down and you canoffer something more tried and true thatalready worked in the past but to anaudience that will pay less and also itsort of insulates them a little bit fromthe supply chain challenges of trying tomake a bunch of newer stuff so theinnovation aka the risk is saved for theeven more expensive phones you know youwatch that iphone 14 pro review and yousee the dynamic island which is a thingthat's new to the iphone it'll evolveover time you see the new 48 megapixelcamera system which is new to the iphoneand you'll see the always on displaywhich again is the first time they'vedone this basically this is all just along-winded way of saying the baselineiphone with this strategy is just boringand that's just the way it is uh so nowfor those who are thinking of actuallybuying one of these phones you'rethinking oh okay i know everything aboutthe phones i know which one i want toget but one last wrench to throw intoall of thisis that the iphone 13 is still on saleand it's 6.99 from apple but you canprobably find it even cheaper from otherplacesand i think that would be a fine upgradefor a lot of people like the one extrayear of software updates is maybe theonly reason i would get a 14 over a 13but aside from that you really got tothink about how muchthe new colors or the slightly newcamera or satellite connectivity orcrash detectionactually means to you and hey ifefficiency means something to you thendefinitely check out this video'ssponsor anchor who makes these chargersand cables that i really like this istheir nano 3 charger which uses galliumnitride that's why it's 70 smaller thanapple's 30 watt charger and it's stillpowerful enough to juice up an iphone oran ipad or a macbook air if you reallywanted to and this 541 cable which isusbc to lightning is the first that i'veseen that uses bio-based materials inthe cable so sugar cane and corn butit's still a high quality cable that canwithstand up to 20 000 bends and it'sactually more durable than a typicalplastic cable and these both come infive colors for your choice to eithermatch your iphone 14 or mix it up alittle bit definitely check both ofthese out at the link below but that'sbeen it thanks for watching let me knowwhat you think of apple's thisrepackagingre-gifting strategy that they've sort ofleaned into more lately either way it'sseptember a lot more is coming updefinitely subscribe if you haven'talready and i'll catch you guys the

oSZkTMVUiNQ,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,is the iphone 14 pro max really worth200 more than the iphone 14 plus orshould you just save that money orinvest it into upgrading your storagewell there are some significantdifferences between these phones and ithink that some of you guys are going toregret the decision that you quicklymade so in this video i will cover notonly all the differences but also thesimilarities and in what ways the 14plus is actually better than the pro maxand ultimately helping you make theright choice i'm going to start out withsome simple differences and then getinto the heavy hitters now you guysobviously know that we have colordifferences and you know your preferenceso i'm going to skip to what reallystands out now the size of the displaysare the same that's a major sellingpoint but what isn't is the materials wehave aluminum on the plus and stainlesssteel on the pro max now stainless steeldoes look nice but there's majordownsides first off fingerprints you cansee them you have to wipe it all thetime compared to aluminum where youdon't have that and i think that younotice scratches way more on thestainless steel as well i definitelynotice it on mine but with that saidif you do drop it the stainless steel ismuch more sturdy and protective withthat the back glass which is veryexpensive to replace does have somedifferences the plus has this shinyfinish that is glossy it shows a lot offingerprintsbut it gives you a nice grip to itwhereas the pro max i love the mattefinish it feels great doesn't leavefingerprintsbut it is a little bit more slippery nowsince we're talking about durabilityscratches and cracks let me tell youabout the sponsor of this video taurusthey make simple unique and veryaffordable cases for iphones includingthe new iphone 14s the first one we haveis the guardian and one unique featureis that you can actually swap out thesenice hard buttons on the side with theseother ones that have different colors ifyou want a little bit of a pop this onehas military grade protection and it hasthis bump which they call an airbag it'spatented and absorbs all the shock toprotect your cameras the next one is theu-pro which has this translucent back onthere that also protects it it has thiskickstand built right in so if you'regoing to be watching movies you pop itright open and it will hold your phonefor you and there is still room forcharging next is the diamond clear whichis slim and lightweight it has ultrahigh transparency and industry leadinganti-yellowing they also have the uproand clear and the guardian with maxsafeso go ahead and check them out using thelinks down below and get yourself a casethat is affordable and that will protectyour phone now apple talked about crashdetection and spent a ton of time onsatellite connectivity and thankfullyboth of the phones have this both ofthem have the same exact waterproofingand a lot of the other upgrades apply aswell such as bluetooth 5.3 which theycould have saved for the pros but theydidn't now the one thing that reallystands out is the difference inprocessors and i have to say that'sprobably not going to be the dealbreaker where people were getting upsetthat the new iphones have an old chipnow if you're comparing to the pro maxthe latest benchmarks do show thatthere's a 17 difference in cpu and aneight percent difference in graphics butof course even the a15 and the a14 wereso fast that it doesn't make a majordifference now one area where i thinkthere is going to be a difference isbattery life with the plus being betternow apple mentioned that has the bestbattery life in any iphone ever but thatwas raiding audio playback whereas invideo playback it is actually worse thanthe 14 pro max and that's just becauseof the extra efficiency of the a16 chipbut personally i think that if you are alighter user you will get better batterylife out of the 14 plusjust because it has a larger battery ingeneral and it doesn't have some ofthese extra features that eat up extrabattery that doesn't show up on thosespec sheets for example we have to talkabout the display because this is wherewe have a ton of differences what reallyshocked everybody was the dynamic islandwhich is the new version of the notchand not only does it look different butthey're using it as a part of the ui soa lot of shortcuts and apps and controlsand notifications are going to be shownthere and this does look super cool itis handy but personally it's not likethis is something that you have to haveit makes a massive difference in actualusability it is more of a luxury featurenow where i do think it will matter isupcoming years and i'll talk about thatat the end now one thing that reallyreally matters to me is the always-ondisplay now apple's able to do thisbecause the screen goes down to onehertz now which saves battery on the 14pro max and of course if you enablealways on display it's going to useextrabut it is so nice to have all yournotifications showing up there just dimsdown and if your phone is laying thereyou see all that instead of having totap it now promotion also taps into thatbecause that variable refresh rate goesup to 120 hertz which makes the phone soso smooth if you've never experiencedthis on the iphone 13s man it is amazingto have but there is a major downside ifall of your other devices that you useonly have 60 hertz for example maybeyour ipadyou know your different computermonitors all of that when you're used toyour iphone everything else just seemsslow and glitchy so at that point youwant to upgrade your other devices or itgets annoying but personally if you canafford it it is nice to have now wherethings get really different are thecameras and i know not everybody caresabout cameras but i still want to touchon it where it really matters appleshowed off the 48 megapixel camera andit looks really good but the 14 plusgets the camera from the iphone 13 promax so it's still a very very goodcamera but there are some limitationsfirst off you're not going to get theprores raw you're not going to getprogress video does not matter i'msomebody so many photos and i will sayno it does not matter i've used both ofthose but they take up way more spacethe results aren't that much better soeven if you get the pro max i don'tthink a lot of you guys will use thatnow with that the action mode stillworks great on both as well as thecinematic mode it works in 4k hdr inboth which is great but the largersensor of the 14 pro max will make itmore accurate along with that thefront-facing cameras are identical theyare both new and much improved so if youlove selfies there's no different butthe other difference really comes inwith that three times telephoto lens andwith lidar having that three timestelephoto allows you to zoom in 15 timesinstead of five and it looks so muchbetter on the iphone 13 series so thesame thing's gonna go with this setup ifyou like to zoom in you have kids oranimals further away it makes a dramaticdifference it also allows you to takeportraits with that lens which does giveyou a whole different perspective morelike a realistic cameraand with that the lidar sensor if youtake portrait shots at night it allowsfor night mode the 14 plus still doesn'thave that and there is a shockingdifferencein terms of the quality the brightnessthe sharpness all of that so overall ifyou care about cameras it is such a hugedifference you have so much more optionswith the 14 pro max now this is where wehave to talk about resale value somepeople don't care about that but otherpeople donow if you're going to be selling your14 plus say in a year from now toupgrade to the 15 well the 15s are goingto get that dynamic island as well atthat point the 14s are going to getoutdated much quicker than previousiphones where we didn't have thatdifference so i would definitely thinkabout that and if you're somebody thatdoesn't resell their phone you keep itfor a long time say three four even fiveyears you have to think well this isactually 200 bucks but what differenceis that price when you spread it overfive years and if you're going to besticking for phone that long that'swhere i would highly recommend to getthe 14 pro max not only do you get thatnew design that's going to stay freshfor a long time with a new notch alwayson display much better cameras you havethe lidar you just get so much morevalue for that 200 price now who shouldbuy the 14 plus i would say two peopleone somebody that doesn't have greateyesight or you really like a big screenbut you know don't care about anythingelse you'd be happy with an iphone 6iphone 7 and two if you need the bestbattery life because if you're not aheavy user and your screen is going tobe off for a long time and you're notgonna be pushing your phone hard withgames and other things the standby timeshould be really good with this phonemuch better than what apple specs showoff so there you guys go please do notmake the wrong choice look over all ofthe differences that i talked about andthink about how long you're going tohave this phone and what that pricedifference really breaks down toover the long term a lot of peopleshould be getting the pro max instead ofthe plus and it looks like based onpre-orders a lot of people arepre-ordering that instead so there youguys go go ahead and check out taurusall those

Z3T_QWeReWw,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"- The iPhone 14 Pro Max is here.It's the best that we have from Apple.How does it compareto one of the best Android smartphones of 2022,the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra?What's up, guys?It's Saf, here on SuperSaf TV.And that's exactly what we're going to be finding outin this video by comparing all of the key differencesof these devices, side by side, SuperSafStyle.Let's initially start off with the build and design.So overall, both are very premiumand both are very good looking deviceswith this matte finish across all of the different colors.The iPhone is available in four colors,a gold, a silver a space black,as well as this deep purple,which I am really liking.The S22 Ultra is also available in four official colors.We've got a white, black, green,which we have here,as well as a burgundy.However, there are some additional exclusive colorsyou can get directly from samsung.com.There's a graphite, a sky blue, and a red.And if you do want to get those colors,you can use my affiliate linkdown in the description below,which will also give you some credit,shameless plug there.Now, for the build,the S22 Ultra has an aluminum frame,the iPhone has a stainless steel frame.So stainless steel,a little bit more premium.But in terms of the glass,we've got Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the S22 Ultra.The iPhone has ceramic shields on the front,and what's Apple called the toughest glasson any smartphone at the back.Now, I'm not somebody who's going to do any drop tests.In my experience,both of these are very premium and very durable.Both devices are also water and dust resistant,we've got an IP68 rating.However, you can submerge the iPhonein water deeper compared to the S22 Ultra.You can do it up to six meters versus 1.5 meters.Now, I'm not sure how useful that's going to be to youif you're taking your device for a swim,but, hey, good to know.Now, with the iPhone 14 Pro Max,it looks pretty much the same as the iPhone 13 Pro Max,so you're not really getting much of a design upgrade,shall we say.The S22 Ultra looks quite a bit differentcompared to the S21 Ultra,so it is a bit more refreshed.We've got flat sides on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,which I really do likebecause it means I can prop this up on a tablewithout having to put anything behind it.The S22 Ultra has symmetrical curved sidesthat go from the back to the front.And even though the S22 Ultra is slightly largerin terms of the height,the width, and the thickness,it doesn't really feel any bigger.And that's also thanks to the factthat it weighs slightly lesscompared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.And that brings us nicely onto the displays.We have beautiful displays on both devices.The S22 Ultra does havea slightly larger 6.8-inch displayversus the 6.7 inch display on the iPhone.Both displays are using OLED technology,so colors are very vibrant.They're both very bright as well,and also very sharp.Now, the S22 Ultra is a tad sharper,it's not something that you're going to noticemuch in your day-to-day,but the iPhone is actually now brightercompared to the S22 Ultra,which is something that I wasn't expecting.We've got a peak brightness of 2,000 nits outdoors,which makes this the brightest displayon any smartphone out right now.Now, that might not be a huge dealfor a lot of people,it is a big plus for me,because I'm always wearing these,and especially when it's a sunny day outdoors,it really makes a difference.And we have an adaptive refresh rateon both devices up to 120 Hertz,making everything really smooth,but both are using LTPO technology,which means that they can go all the way downto one Hertz,which is going to make them more efficient.As well as that,it means that both can have Always On displays.Yes, the iPhone finally hast an Always On display.If you've been watching me here on the channel,you'll know that I've been complainingabout this for many, many years.Now, it's finally here,and it's quite different to the S22 Ultra .So with the S22 Ultra,I do quite like it.You get little icons for notifications,and you can see which apps those have come from.And you do have some customization,you can choose amongst lots of different clock styles,and you can also specify when you wantthe Always On display to come on and off.On the iPhone,you can pretty much switch the Always On display on or off.You can't specify times.It's going to work things out automatically.When you're sleeping,it's going to turn off by itself.If it's in your pocket,it's going to know it's in your pocket,and it's going to switch off.And it does offer a lot of customization,and that's because it's essentially your lock screen,just dimmed down.So including your wallpaper will be displayedon the full Always On,whereas on the S22 Ultra,if you don't want to have an image,it's just going to take up a small section.So both of these have advantages and disadvantages.Personally speaking, I do like them both.Now, looking at the screen to body ratio,we do have a higher screen to body ratioon the S22 Ultra,because we do have slightly smaller bezels,as well as a very small punch out.Now, on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,the bezels are slightly smallercompared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max.And finally, we no longer have a notch,we have what's Apple are calling a Dynamic Island,which is this pill-shaped cutout here in the middle.Now, this does take up more spacecompared to the small punch outs on the S22 Ultra,however, it does bring in lots of new functionality.I've covered this in previous videos,but essentially, you're going to be ableto have music playing here at the top,which you can then long-press an action,or you can have some shortcuts on here.You can have a separate bubble displaying a stopwatch,or if you're on a call.And overall, I am quite liking this Dynamic Island,because it's a different implementationwhich we haven't really seen before.So overall, excellent displays on both devices,some of the best out there in the market.I don't think you can go wrong with either.Traditionally, it's been an easy win for the Samsungbecause the iPhone has generally not been as bright,and it's had that notch,but Apple has really stepped up the display game this year,and I can safely say that this time,it is definitely a draw.Now, one of the reasons why we havethis larger pill-shaped cutout on the iPhoneis because of Face ID.So Face ID is still here,and it works as expected,it's very fast.It also now works with mask,which it didn't do previously,and it's something that I was feeding back for a long time.The S22 Ultra has an under display fingerprint scanner.It's an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner,which in my opinion,is the best under display fingerprint scanneron a mainstream flagship.And realistically speaking,you can't go wrong with either.Both of these work really, really well.Traditionally, I used to favor the S22 Ultrafor the fingerprint scannerbecause I used to have issues when wearing a maskwith Face ID,but now that Apple have updated this,it's not too much of an issue.Right, next up, let's talk about the cameras.Boo, sorry, sorry, man.Before I remind you to subscribe,I just wanted you to let you knowthat we've actually done a SuperSafStyle camera comparisonbetween the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra.You can check it out after you've watched this video,and also after your subscribeand hit that bell icon.Yeah, that's it from me, sorry.You heard the man.If you haven't already,do consider subscribing if you're enjoying the video.Right, as SideSaf mentioned,if you do want the full breakdown,it's 20 minutes long.You can check out that camera comparison.But to give you a brief summary,we do have an ultra wide camera on both,a primary sensor,which is now a larger size sensor on the iPhone,as well as a three times telephoto camera.The S22 Ultra does havean additional periscope zoom camera,which will give you up to 10 times optical zoom.And generally speaking,I think you can't go wrong with either of these cameras.They both take amazing images and video.With the S22 Ultra,you do get that versatility of focal lens,and that zoom is, I would say, one of the best out there.You also get a better ultra wide camera, in my opinion,with better dynamic range,and you get the best edge detectionthat I've tested on any smartphone.With the iPhone,I think you get an overall more consistent package.With better low light performance,especially in the video.And the iPhone, once again, is still king in videowith great dynamic range,exceptional stabilization,especially with the new action mode,and a very usable cinematic video mode,where it's going to blur the background.I was actually really impressed with this.So once again, excellent cameras overall on both devices.I wouldn't have a problem picking up either of these.You can check out the SuperSafStyle camera comparisonif you want more details,but, I know a lot of you guys are going to ask me,which one of these would I pick upfor an overall camera package for photos, videos,all of the different features?And for me, personally,it would be the iPhone 14 Pro Max.You happy?Right, now, let's move on to the performance.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is poweredby Apple's A16 Bionic chip,the S22 Ultra is going to be poweredby either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1or the Samsung Exynos 2200 depending on your region.You do get more RAM on the S22 Ultra,and in my experience,both of these are amazing,they've got no issues whatsoever,have handled everything that I've thrown at them.Now, I'm not somebody who's going to go detailedinto benchmarks and looking at frame rates,and things like that.I would say that the iPhone 14 Pro Maxwill get a bit of an edgebecause it does have a newer chipset.The S22 Ultra has the 8 Gen 1,which came out earlier.We do now have the 8+ Gen 1 on many other devices.And performance will also come down to the software.And of course we have iOS versus Android.I don't go into debates between these two,and it's come to a pointwhere you really can't go wrong with either OS.I think it's going to come downto which ecosystem you prefer and want to get into.Obviously, with the iPhone,you're going to have things like iMessage,AirDrop, and I do like some of the new featuresthat have come with iOS 16,such as the remove background feature.On the S22 Ultra,it's actually tied in really wellwith the Samsung ecosystem.So if you do have other Samsung devices,you'll also enjoy that experience.Once again, I think this is going to definitely come downto personal preference.I know a lot of you hate it when I say that,but that is literally the case.Now, looking at the speakers,we've got stereo speakers on both devices.There's one speaker in the earpieceand one bottom firing.And both actually sound really, really good to me.Now, I am no audio fellow,but my buddy Thunder E from ""BooredAtWork"" is,and he's actually done a detailed speaker test.I don't want to spoil it too much,but I think the edge does overallgo to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Let's now talk about some of the additional featuresthat you're going to get on both devices,which you're not really going to find on many others.So with the S22 Ultra, you, of course,have the S Pen,which is now enclosed within the device.The Samsung Galaxy S seriestraditionally has not had an S Pen,although on the S21 series,you could buy it separately.They seem to have merged the Note with the S series,and we've got the S22 Ultra.I'm personally a big fan of the S Pen.I love it for just some quick doodling,some photo editing,or if you want to sign a documentwhen you're out and about.I don't use it all the time,but when I do use it,it is so useful to have.You've got a 2.8 millisecond latency,which makes this very, very smooth,and it's such a unique experiencewhich I do appreciate.The S22 Ultra also has DeX support.So you'll be able to wirelessly connect thisto a display.Use your S22 Ultra as a trackpad,and get a desktop experience.Now, the iPhone has some unique features of its own.We now have Crash Detection,so in the unfortunate eventwhere you are in a car crash,the iPhone has sensors,which will detect this,and if you don't respond,it can actually contact emergency serviceson your behalf,which is really, really useful.It also has emergency SOS via satellite.So if you are in the middle of nowhere,you've got no reception,and you need to contact emergency services,it's going to be able to show youwhere the satellites are,connect to them,and send those emergency messages.Now, initially, it's only going to be availablein the US and Canada,hopefully should be coming to other areas soon,and it's going to be included for two years.After which, I believe there's going to besome sort of subscription model.Now, I have to mentionthat we have different ports on these.The S22 Ultra has the more universal USB Type-C,the iPhone 14 Pro Max still has a lightning cable,which I'm not too happy about.I mean, a lot of other Apple devicessuch as the iPads and the MacBookall use the USB Type-C universal port.And it's so annoying when I have to carrya lightning cable when I am traveling.So USB Type-C is definitely the way,and I believe Apple may be forced to use USB Type-Cby Europe very, very soon.We'll see next year,however they say it is still lightning.Now, if you are based in the US,you will no longer have a physical SIM card trayfor the iPhone,you will be having to use eSIM only.It's a pretty straightforward process,but it's something that you'll have to get used to.You do have a physical SIM card tray on the S22 Ultra.Right, now, let's talk about batteries and charging.So the S22 Ultra does have a larger physical battery,but, of course,it's not all about size,depending on the context.And in this context,the iPhone does have better battery life in my experience.I'd say I'm getting around about 20% better battery lifeon the iPhone 14 Pro Max versus the S22 Ultra .Now, for charging, the S22 Ultra does get the advantage,although neither of these come with a chargerout of the box.It does support faster chargingup to 45 watts versus 20 watts.So on the S22 Ultra,you can get a 50% charge in around 20 minutes,whereas on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,that's going to be more like around 30 minutes.Now, both of these do support wireless charging.You have up to 15 watts of wireless chargingon the S22 Ultra.On the iPhone 14 Pro Max,you've got 7.5 watts using a standard Qi wireless charger.But if you do want to use Apple's proprietary MagSafe charger,you can get up to 15 watts.I do like MagSafe,it just snaps on to the back,and you don't have to have a situationwhere you've not placed your smartphoneon a wireless charger correctly.But then again, it is proprietary,it's not just your standard,which I do prefer.The S22 Ultra also does have Wireless PowerShare,so you'll be able to charge things like earbudson the back of the S22 Ultra.And it's not something that I have used much at all,but it might be useful in some situations.Right, finally, let's lookat the storage versions and pricing.So both of these are available in the same storage variants,128, 256, 512 gigabytes,as well as a massive one terabyte version.Now, if you do look at launch prices of the S22 Ultra,it is priced higher in the US compared to the iPhone,but lower in the UK compared to the iPhone.Apple have increased the price for the new iPhone 14quite a bit in the UK and other regions.And I'm not sure why this is,but it is a little bit unfortunate for usliving here in the UK.And with the S22 Ultra,because it has been out for a few months now,you can actually get it lowerthan what it initially came out for.I've seen it for around about 900 to 8,000 poundsdepending on where you get it.And Samsung also are offeringlots of really good trading deals,as well as additional credit using my affiliate linkdown in the description.You don't have to use it if you don't want to,but if you are going to get an S22 Ultra,you may as well.So overall, you will be paying less in most regionsfor the S22 Ultra,and now that it is a few months oldcompared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.And that is the detailed comparisonbetween the iPhone 14 Pro Maxand the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, SuperSafStyle.Personally speaking, I like both devices.I think they've both got their advantages and disadvantages.But it's never been closer.I love to see this competition,and I'm personally going to be using both of these devices.One of my SIM is going to go in the S22 Ultraand the other is going to go into the iPhone 14 Pro Max.That's what I think anyway.What do you guys think?Which one of these would you pick?Do let me know down in the comments below.There's going to be lots more iPhone 14 coveragehere on

JqyxHeQksNs,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,today we have the reveal of the new iphone 14  pro max and that's coming up right after this!so today we've got a stunning reveal of the  iphone 14 series including more confirmation  of specs before we get started though like the  video if you're a fan of apple let me know in the  comments what your most wanted iphone 14 feature  is if you haven't already then hit subscribe now  so you don't miss a thing in the future apple's  largest supplier foxconn have already began trial  production for the iphone 14 pro and this suggests  that apple have finalized its design already  many people are still doubting its new  design but we keep seeing it again and again  now apple have kept with the notch and avoided a  punch hole camera for many years now but the notch  is becoming outdated and it's time for a change  with the new display yesterday display analyst  ross young has given apple's roadmap in terms of  the display choices and as you can see for the  iphone 14 we've got a notch on the standard models  and then a pill shape and a punch hole on the pros  now of course the standard models are the iphone  14 and the new iphone 14 max and the pro models  are going to be the iphone 14 pro and the iphone  14 pro max now according to ross young this pill  cut out and the punch hole camera is also going  to pass through to the 2023 models which is hardly  surprising considering just how long apple have  already stuck with the notch now next year even  the standard models are also getting these punch  holes so that means no more notch when it comes  to display leaks ross young has a 100 track record  so we can be pretty sure that this is accurate now  we also had elite schematics for the new punch  hole design last week and now shrimp apple pro  has posted some new information via twitter now  his image shows the cutout is 5.6mm in diameter  and although the pill shape next to it is smaller  you can see a faint outline around the edge which  is the same size and this is going to be the  black pill shape that we see on the display  now next up we've got a tweet from majin buu on  twitter and this shows us the screen protector  for the iphone 14 and the iphone 14 pro max  now personally i would definitely say to take  these with a grain of salt the bezels are way  thinner than normal considering the iphone 14  is still keeping the notch i just don't see this  being correct now other people have pointed out  that these look exactly the same as the screen  protectors for the s22 series so there's a good  chance that they are with the design finalized  though the pill shape and the punch hole camera is  pretty much confirmed technizo concept has created  a new trailer using all of this information  and it looks stunning now this is a concept  trailer but it's based on all the reliable leaks  and it's pretty much exactly what we can expect to  see later this year when they released the iphone  14 pro max now in this trailer we get a great look  from multiple different angles and as you can see  it's going to be the same design as last year with  this new display and of course better hardware  i've also placed links to Technizo Concepts  channel down in the description below  if you want to go and take a look at all his  other concepts but overall the iphone 14 is  bringing the latest hardware in a more refined  design while many are still unsure of this new  display i think personally it does make it look  a lot more modern than a notch and it's probably  gonna grow on people with time for those excited  for the iphone 14 series though we're now going to  run through the full specs design and the expected  pricing for all four models in the series for my  regular viewers you guys have seen this so just  skip to the next video but if you are new here  then don't forget to hit subscribe and we'll get  right into it to start with the new entry level  model is going to be the iphone 14

oTtbIf1TfL8,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"- Hey, guys, it's Justine.And today we are unboxing all of the iPhone 14s.We have the new iPhone 14 Pro Max in the purple,the iPhone 14 Pro in the space black,and the iPhone 14 in this beautiful blue color.We don't have the Plus, because that does come out later.But right now we're gonna unbox all three of theseand check them out.(gasps) Oh, look at you.I did see it at the event,but like seeing it here in person,in my very own studio,is so exciting!Look at it, this blue is honestly,I think one of my favorite colors.It's just like the perfect baby blue color.(gentle music)It's beautiful.This does have that all-glass back,and I like the frosted camera bump right there.It does look really nice.And I really like that the aluminum sides heredo not get fingerprints.Because in the Pros,it has the shiny, stainless-steel finishand you get so many fingerprints on it.With this, even though it is aluminum, no fingerprints.One down, two to go.Oh, look at this, USB-C cable.Here's the iPhone 14 Pro,look at that box, beautiful,shiny, shimmering, splendid.(sticker peeling)(gasps) Oh, the black looks so nice.I really was struggling on which one to orderfor my personal phone.I did order the silver,and I know I probably should have got the purplebecause it is the new color,but I had gold the last two phonesand I decided to go with the silverjust because I like having the light camera showingwhenever I have a case on it.Ready for the peel.(gentle music)There was like, no sound.There was no ASMR peel sound.Okay, this black looks so good on camera.Just moving this around in the light, (gasps) wow.This makes me even more excited to open up the purple.Speaking of which, let's do it.This is our all-new, deep purple color.Let's check it out.(gasps) Oh no, did I make a mistake?Should I have ordered the purple?Jake, you ordered the purple didn't you?Mm, it's really pretty.(gasps) It's so pretty.Oh my goodness, wow!My sister also ordered the purple, what was I thinking?Look at that, oh my God, it's nice.It's so nice.My precious.I've never seen the movie, I don't get the reference,but this just looks so pretty.Okay, ready? Time for the peel.I'm like whispering, I don't know why I'm whispering.There's just nobody else here.(upbeat music)You look great.So we now have all three of our devices, all unboxed.Look at them, look at this beautiful lineup.My children, I'm so proud.So now we have our phones, let's check out the accessories.So here's the iPhone 14 Pro Max Leather Case.This is in the purple.Ooh, wait, is this purple?Pro Max Leather Case, oh, it's this is in ink.This looks nice.It's not really a purple color,but it's more of like a kind of a navy,but it does have a purple kind of tint to it.There's the case and the phone.(upbeat music)As much as I don't like putting cases on my phone,I have to, because I cannot be trusted.Now we're gonna open up the leather walletthat comes in the ink color as well.I did some weird stuff with my pre-order.I pre-ordered a pink chalk casewith the orange wallet.What was I even thinking?Is that a combo that's gonna look good?I'm not sure, but that's what I ordered.So since I would say about last yearI have pretty much been only a MagSafe Wallet person,I never thought that this was somethingthat I would ever be able to do.And I've made it an entire yearonly with this wallet on the back of my phone.It's also made me keep way less cards than I did before.I basically have one credit card,I have my driver's license and my Tesla key card.And if anybody remembers my video from last year,I went and bought my Teslainstead of filming my iPhone 13 video.I'm so nervous, I've wanted one for a really long time.Okay, it went through.Ah!No! - Hold up, hold up!Oh my gosh! (upbeat music)- The iPhone 14 Pro is all suited up.Let's close our iPhone 14 Pro.This is the iPhone 14 Silicon Case.This is in the midnight color.I'm confused as to what the midnight color is,because it's not blue, but it's also not black,like a dark navy blue color.Oh, that looks, that looks pretty black to me.Like this midnight has more of a blue.This looks way more black, interesting.Okay, let's put on your outfit.(gasps) That looks really nice too, voila.We've got our iPhone 14 Silicon Case.This is in storm blue.Oh, that's a much darker blue than I thought.My mom would love this color.She loves the color blue.I think I'm gonna have to get her this color iPhone case.Hey, let's put your clothes on.Look at you looking so pretty.This is a perfect combo.I like that this has like the dark blue around the edge.It kind of compliments the light blue, matches the logo.Like this looks good, this is a beautiful combination.See here's the previous blue color casethat I have right now on my phone.It's almost like the same colorI feel like as the iPhone 14,very similar colors.Yeah, so here's the 12 Pro Max blue,that matches pretty close to this new case.Look at our friends.The whole gang is here.- Hi, I'm Siri. - Hi, I'm Siri.- Hi, I'm Siri. - Hi, I'm Siri.- I told Tim Cook that I was ordering the purple phone.- [Jake] You lied to Tim Cook's face.- I did, but honestly, at the time,I thought that I was gonna get the purple.- So which one are you gonna get, the deep purple?- The deep purple for sure. - Yeah, that's what I did.- Yeah, man, I lied to Tim Cook.(gentle music)So here's all three of the phones.The Pro model, as you can see, has the Always-On display.So this is actually not on.I mean, it's on, but it's not.Now it's on.This is our iPhone 14,which does not have the Always-On display.Look at that, it's cool.All right, we are all unboxed,and now it's time to go out and test them out.(gentle music)So here they are, the new iPhone 14s.We've got the iPhone 14,the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max.With a new brighter display on the Proswith a max Nit brightness of 2000,increased performance camera enhancements,Crash Detection, and new emergency satellite connectivity,let's say hello to this year's iPhones.(gentle upbeat music)The iPhone 14 has a 6.1 inch XDR max 1200 Nits display,durable ceramic shield,12 megapixel front-facing camerawith 49% improved low light.Along with the new 14,they have an iPhone 14 Plus option with a larger display.These do have the same A15 Bionic chipas the iPhone 13 Pros from last year,but with thermal optimizations,to basically make this a 13 Proin a new 14 body upgrade for less.Now the iPhone 14 Pros have an additional telephoto lensthat the iPhone 14 does not have.The display is 1600 Nits with a max brightness of 2000,and now the display has the ability to be always on.With the new A16 Bionic chip,we can shoot 48 megapixel RAW photos,an all-new Action Mode to stabilize your video,and improved camera systemwith up to 3X improved low light on the ultra camera,a new 2X telephoto option.And the most exciting new feature?Turning that cut out into something actually quite usefulfor notifications and controlling your content.Now only the iPhone 14 Pro modelswill have the Dynamic Island,the iPhone 14 still has the notch.(upbeat music)So we're now outside and I've got both of the phones.I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the iPhone 14,and we're gonna go around and take some photos,take some videos.We're definitely gonna be testing out that Action Mode,and spoiler, I've already tested it out,and I am so impressed.I can't even explain,can't wait to show you guys.(gentle music)Cinematic Mode got an upgrade this year on the 14s.You can now shoot in 4K,24 frames a second and 30 frames a second.Now before, you could only shoot in 1080and you couldn't actually change the frame rateto 24 frames a second.So I'm very excited that now Cinematic Modehas actually become a little more cinematic.Now on the 14, you only have one lens option.But on the 14 Pro Max,you can shoot in 1X and 3X.So let's see what they look like.(upbeat music)So the thing that's cool about Cinematic Mode is,in post, you're able to select the thingsthat you want to be in focus.So right now I am choosing the tree to be selected.That's in focus.And then, if I want myself to be in focus, I just tap.And guess what?Now I'm in focus.And this is really cool,because we're basically able to do this on a phone.Normally, you would need all typesof high-end lenses and all kinds of gear to make this work,and it's just like magic.(upbeat music)Now here's a test of the 3X zoom on Cinematic.And like I said, on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,you're able to get a 3X zoom.So this is what it looks like in 3X.Now let's go to 1X.And in that same position,here is what it looks like in the 1X.This is kind of cool,'cause it'll give you a variety of waysto shoot in Cinematic Mode.(upbeat music)So Macro Mode is now a little bit more crispthan the previous iPhone 12.So I'm so excited to test this out,because even last year when I first got Macro Mode,it was so shocking because it's so crispand you can get so close to things.So like look how close I am to this cactus.Like I'm touching it.I also think I might have got stabbed.(upbeat music)♪ We're ""Driving Cars onto Mars Tonight"" ♪- So on Macro Mode, it's supposed to give ussome crisper photos.So let's take a coupleand we can compare it to the iPhone 13.I'm so close to this tree,like my lens I feel like is touching it.(mellow music)And this right here is the Macro Mode.So if I decide that I don't wanna shoot in Macro,I can turn that offand I'll be able to shoot a regular photo.But if I want that back on, press it,and we are in business.Like the thing is the iPhone 13is still an incredible phone.Like these photos still look really great.(mellow music)So we're back here in the studio,and I wanna give you guys a closer lookat the Dynamic Island,and this has been actually super impressive.But now that I've been going back and using my iPhone 13,it's been so weird without it'cause I actually really miss it.Even though Apple is using thisas a way to kind of have a little distractionaway from the pill-shape design that is kind of therebecause it has to be there,for the camera, and for the Face ID,and the infrared, it's actually really, really helpful.So, for an example, I will open up some Spotify here.Let's, of course, listen to a little Bebe Rexha,this new track is fire.So it automatically goes up there,at the top right here.And when you press into it,the notification kind of pops downand you can have access to pause,to play, make it go away.Now if we start a timer, for instance,this will also go up to the top,and you'll see it's right here.We can have access to the timer.I can stop that over it.I also have really liked this for screen recording,because I do a lot of screen recordingsall the time when I'm making videos.So having this little screen recorderpop up at the top is super helpful.Another thing that I really like it for is Face ID,and it'll automatically give all of my infoand I can log in.(upbeat music)So now we're gonna test out Action Mode.And the reason that I have these set up like thisis because I wanted to test the iPhone 14 Prosup against each other.So one is gonna be recording in Action Mode,and the other is not gonna be recording in Action Mode,and we're gonna show you guys the difference.So in Action Mode, it's actually punching in slightly,so there is a little bit of a crop.And because of that,you will notice that if you are shooting in ultra widethat there is a little bit more of a cropthan when you're shooting in ultra widewhen you're not using Action Mode.Here we go, all right, Action Mode.(feet striking pavement quickly)Wah!Okay, so these are both in 0.5,now let's switch to one.So my Action Mode camera is staying at 0.5,and I've switched the other one to oneso you can kind of see the similar crop.(feet striking pavement quickly)I'm getting so much activity with these reviews.Okay, Jake, you ready to follow me?- No. - Let's go!(feet striking pavement quickly)Woo!Watching both of these back is so shocking.I mean, even the one that's not in Action Modeis still pretty steady.But when you compare that to Action Mode,like I was running really fast.Also, something that was kind of coolis even at the beginning where I asked Jake a questionand he moved the phones,the Action Mode one didn't even move at all.Now, most of the time, you're not gonna be runningaround full speed chasing people,so what is a more real-world scenariowhen you would use Action Mode?Maybe just walking around, vlogging, filming.So now one of these is recording in Action Mode,which is this one right here,and the other is recording in 1X,which would be the equivalent because of the crop.Now this is more of a normal,I feel like, everyday scenario,walking around talking, vlogging.And then, if I were to take the camera off of you, Jake,this is what it would look like.There's my friends back there.Here we are.What if I jump?What if I spin around in circles?I dunno.(upbeat music)The new iPhone 14 has a 1600 Nit displaywith peak brightness up to 2000.This is so excitingbecause I'm always using my phone outside,and on bright, sunny days,especially here in Los Angeles,it's pretty bright and you can still see your display.(upbeat music)Now one of the things that you need to set upwhen you get your iPhoneis make sure that the formats are correct.You have to go into the camera settings,turn on Apple ProRAW,and you wanna make sure that the resolutionis set to 48 megapixelsto really take advantage of that full format.And another thing that I recommend,this is my favorite, is the Macro Control.So you wanna make sure that that is on as well,because that will let you adjust the macroif it's on or off.And sometimes you might not actuallywant to use it when you're taking a photo,so it's always best to turn that on.(upbeat music)Crash Detection is something new in the iPhone 14and in the Apple Watches.So if you do happen to,unfortunately, get into a car accident,the Apple Watch and the iPhonewill both be able to alert emergency authoritiesthat there has been an accidentand they can be directed directly to the scene.But I think it's such an amazing safety precaution,and I'm so excited that that is somethingthat they decided to putin all of the new devices this year.(upbeat music)Launching in November,you'll have access to satellite communication.So I'm personally very excited about this,because I do have a satellite phonethat I like to take with me hiking.Now the one downside to the iPhone satellite communicationis it really is only for emergencies.Whereas, the satellite that I pay for monthly,which is like $60 a month through Garmin,you can actually connect to the satellites,send text messages and communicate.So yes, it is for emergencies,but you can still send text messages.Whereas, only the satellite on the iPhoneis for emergency response.So you really can't goand text message your friends using satellite.It's only to contact the authoritiesand let them know that you have a problem.It's kind of cool how they made this workis they actually will turn your phoneinto the satellite finder.So as you're moving around,the iPhone will direct you to where the satellite is.It'll then connect you to the emergency responders.They've done something very interesting thoughwith the text messages,they're able to condense the size of that text messageto ensure it gets delivered.A lot of times when you're communicating with satellites,it can take five, 10, 15, 20 minutesto just send a single messageup and back down to the recipient.So they've made it that the file sizeis as small as possibleto make sure that your message gets delivered.So that means if I wash up on a beach,just like this,and I didn't have my phoneor any reception, guess what?I can call for help on my satellite device,my iPhone 14, love it.(upbeat music)So we're shooting this right now in ProRes.I thought I would test it out.It's kind of amazingthat I'm able to shoot ProRes 4K RAW on an iPhone.It's pretty impressive.(upbeat music)(gentle upbeat music)We're at the beach now,the sun is about to setand I'm testing out the front-facing camera.Because one of the things that they did updateis the front-facing camera,which like I'm kind of excited about,but also not excited,because the front-facing is where I liketo take those nice selfies.We don't need to see all of the lines,we don't need to see all the details.Apple you're making things too good now.Ugh, #nofilter.(upbeat music)- [Jake] Three, two, one.(upbeat music)- Something I've been so excited to test outis the low-light photography.It has been improved in the new iPhone 14,so we're gonna do a little comparisonbetween the 14 and the 13.Now it might look like on camera herethat there's a lot of light.I mean, I guess we can turn off those overhead lightsto see what they look like.So lights on, oh wow.That's way darker.It looks like daylight when I hold this up.It also takes faster Night Mode photosbecause of the A16 Bionic chip,so you don't have to hold your phone as still for so long.So let's take a couple and test it out.- [Jake] We've got the new iPhone over here,and I'm gonna go ahead and take a picture, one, two, three.So definitely looks, just first impressions, sharper.- Hmm. - And then, three, two, one.(upbeat music)- Wow, okay, so it already looks way cleaner.- [Jake] The right one looks better.- This one? - Yeah.- Yeah, this is new. - [Jake] Okay, good.The one on the right looks way better.You can see the blur now.- Yep, it is blurry too.(mellow music)I've been having so much fun testing out these phones.And one of my favorite features,which is kind of surprising,is having the Always-On display.It's kind of shocking every time I look down at my phonewhen it's just sitting at the table and it's on,it's on, but it's not on.I also enjoy testing out all of the new features,like the Cinematic Mode,and the Action Mode was definitely one of the thingsthat was really shocking.It worked so well, I can't wait to use that more.I'll have a bunch more videos coming out very soon,so if you haven't already,please subscribe,hit the bell to be notified when I post new videos.And I have some other videos herethat you may be interested in,Apple related, of course.And with that, I'll see you guys in the next video, bye.(mellow music)"
5owJZIHvIPM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,foreign[Music]for the last week I've been activelyusing the new iPhone 14 pro and I dohave something to say this year'srelease didn't go as smoothly as Applehoped it would this phone gave me somany different emotions both good andbad and now when I'm done playing withit I can make a solid conclusion onwhether you should buy this phone orwait another year but let's start withdiscussing what has changed in a goodway and kick it off with the mostvisible change we see the screenit has received a noticeable upgradeover the 13 Pro now it's brighter andslightly bigger now it can go up to 2000nits instead of 1000 nits on the 13 Prothis difference may be seen onlyOutdoors without a brightness turned onthe sun wasn't round to assist intesting but our really bright lightpanel did the job the difference isthere but almost unnoticeable to thenaked eye and if we take throttling intoaccount most of the time the brightnesswill be more or less equal to the lastyear's Flagship but we both know you'renot here to listen to me ranting aboutthe brightness you're here to find outwhether the dynamic island is a featureor a gimmick the presentation didportray it as a revolutionary featurebut after a week I do have reasons todoubt it let me explain I must admit thefirst few days after I've received thisiPhone I just couldn't help butpointlessly open apps checking how thepeninsula will adapt it's reallysomething that gives a feeling of atotally new phone but if we put thefeeling of novelty aside how does thedynamic Island change the userexperience well I can confidently saythat this feature is a really niceaddition now I can see what music isplaying how long it's left until thetimer buzzes and a ton of other thingsand I'm a YouTuber so my job is to showyou pros and cons and one of thedisadvantages the list of apps thatsupport this feature is low now I'm surea few months from now there will be aton of useful applications but now itfeels more like a feature just for thesake of it before we tackle thatinsanely loud camera gate issue let'sfinish the screen up the always onscreenwell for me this feature isn't reallyworking all that well don't get me wrongit's a great feature but the way Appleimplemented it just totally throws meoff it's just too bright I think givingus the ability to change the brightnessof this always on screen would be niceit seems to be on all the time thisbrightness varies depending on yourenvironment the screen even turns offwhen it's too dark like in a darkbedroom so it won't distract you whenyou sleep the overall design is smartand well thought out but the point stillstands too bright yeah it looks nice butI often find myself placing the phoneface down just not to be distracted byit additionally it decreases the batterylife by about four to five percent Idon't know what was the point of addingthis feature but they totally epped upto deliver a good battery life 13 Proeasily lasted almost two days for me butthe new 14 pro is barely enough to getme for the second day's breakfast theperformance that's probably the leastproblematic part of everyone's userexperience with this phone but is thea16 really as good as Apple claims it tobe well the improvements are real butthey aren't all that noticeable the onlything I was worried about was throttlingthe iPhone 13 Pro was Notorious forthrottling so has anything changed wellit didn't change that much throttling isstill an issue so be ready to use yourfancy new iPhone at 50 brightnessbesides that the overall performance isstill Top Notch it's enough for any taskyou can throw at it but I dare you tonotice the difference between the 13 Proand 14 pro it's minuscule the one thingthat really grinds my gears is thesoftware and how raw the third-partyapps are I know this is more in relationto this Dynamic Island but somethird-party apps are somewhat unusablethe resolution has changed and nowdevelopers must rework their apps forthese new screens and until they do willstruggle with incorrectly placedelements but buttons texts who knows howlong it will take for them to releaseupdates that's really frustratingespecially after you pay a thousanddollars for a new phone one more thingabout software when you are recordingyour screen the cutout stays as a blackelement on the video itself that's not avery good thing we never had that beforenow let's move to something that'sreally important the camera the camerasystem has received the biggest upgradesince 2016. the main sensor is 48megapixel and the results I got are notall that obvious see for yourself thedynamic range is improved the colors areslightly more Vivid and realistic thanksto the bigger sensor the focal distanceis now bigger resulting in a betterbokeh the small thing I've noticed arethe blurry edges on close-up shots let'stake faces for example on the 13 Pro thewhole image stays sharp and in Focus butthe 14 pro really gives those soft edgesto everything outside the Center Maymaybe for Landscapes this isn'tnoticeable but for close-ups it can be adeal breaker Additionally the field ofview has changed but not in a good waythe image now is wider which isobviously great for landscapephotography but it is awful forportraits also Apple has said a lotabout improved low light performancepersonally I can see the improvementsbut they are not as significant as youcan expect those claims of two timesbetter shots in reality translate toapproximately 30 Improvement the trickything is that these improvements arenoticeable only when you look closerless noise better exposure and whitebalance more details but if you arelooking at the photos only on yourphone's screen or in social media thedifference is not as noticeable lowlight shots are better but not enough tojustify the purchase Oh and those Proraw images definitely not my main modethe image quality is noticeably betterwhen compared side by side there aremore details the colors are softer lessvibrant no matter what you arephotographing it will look visiblybetter with prara turned on the truedifference can be seen after editing theimage it is night and day especiallywhen you look closer the depth of theimage the textures the Shadows just theway they are without too manycomputational photography algorithmsthis mode does preserve all the detailsand colors I can see myself using it onreally memorable moments but daily Iwill prefer basic 12 megapixel photosnow it should get interesting the Shakercamera sadly or luckily my phone isn'tsubjected to this issue some users havereported their cameras when usingthird-party apps were buzzing vibratingand producing awful looking footage butthe software update did emerge ratherquickly and hopefully fixed this issueand if not well we have a difficultconversation coming Apple the nextfeatures we're gonna discuss are alsoproblematic the updated cinematic modedoes detect edges better and supports 4K resolution at 24 FPS but the colorsare inconsistent how it can even becalled cinematic when you have zerocontrol over the white balance plus ifyou're trying to shoot cinematic videosin less well-lit environments everythingstarts looking like an oil painting it'sgreat that Apple Updates this mode andgives the opportunity to regular peopleto fill like Pro filmmakers but there isa long way to go until this mode willreally become cinematic and the actionmode well I got mixed feelings about itthis mode has one big issue quality andI'm not talking about the 2.8 Kresolution but about the video itselfthe phone does use the ultra wide lensby default which results in very lowdetailed images no matter which lens youchoose manually there will still begrain noise and poor littleizationthat's the issue Beyond solving I wouldrecommend using this mode only inwell-lit environments if you're tryingto capture the memorable moment andthere is a lot of light this action modeis a Behavior but in low light it wouldbe better to shoot regular video thefront-facing camera is better and hasautofocus luckily Apple did everythingright here the faces are sharper moredetailed and led better skin tone ismore accurate thanks to the newprocessing algorithms the difference ismore apparent in the low light thephotos have less noise flares and arebetter details those who love selfieswill surely notice a difference overallI can conclude that the camera upgradewe've got can't justify the purchase ofthe new iPhone 14 pro the photos areonly a tiny bit better which is totallynegligible the build quality isexceptional nothing interesting here thebody is virtually identical to the 13Pro so you won't notice any differencein terms of sensation all elements arefit together nicely no gaps or unevenseams are present it's a premium phoneso it totally satisfies all expectationsin this domain unfortunately I wasn'table to test the satellite connectivitybecause it's not yet available in myarea so let's leave that for later Ipromise to make a video as soon as I getlost somewhere I just hope that featurewill save me because if not well therewill be no video for you on the otherhand I was lucky not to test the crashdetection I know you want me to test itout but I do value my life and money 20KSubs what do you want from me a crashtest let's make it 100K at least anywayI believe this feature works really wellwhat can I say in the end is the iPhone14 pro a worthy upgrade the camera isbetter the screen is better a ton of newfeatures but would I spend my money onit well yes but actually no I think thatthose upgrades we've got are equallybalanced with all the problems thus theoverall let of benefits over the 13 Prois rather small but it's my job to testeverything out so I will use it for awhile maybe it will grow on me or maybeI will switch back to my 13 pro stickaround to find out
RsbttOwoQ4M,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,So we've had apple's far out event where we saw  the likes of the brand new iphone 14 models and  we also saw the new iphone 14 pro models and a lot  of you guys are wondering what are the iphone 14  pro models in comparison to each other and how  much better are they like over the last year's  generation the iphone 13 pro max well today i'm  going to do a comparison for you i'm going to do  an iphone 14 pro versus the iphone 14 pro max  review of specs and without further ado guys  let's begin so then as you can see here we have  the iphone 14 pro and gold on the left and we have  the iphone 14 pro max in the new purple color on  the right and this is how the comparison is going  to go so first let's talk about the display type  so both of these iphones have an oled display and  we've had our led technology and iphone since  the iphone 10 or the iphone x whatever you want  to call it and this hasn't really changed in  the sense of that it's oled however that oed  technology has got better in the sense that we  do actually have brighter displays and both these  phones can go up to 2 000 nits and the depth color  is also amazing too of both these phones they're  the actual screen size now this is where there is  a big difference this is the most noticeable from  both between the phones the iphone 14 pro has a  6.1 inch display this is the same as the 13 pro  and also the same as the 12 pro whereas the iphone  14 pro max is a 6.7 inch display and again that's  been the same since the 12 pro max the 13 pro max  and they're in the same chassis for both of these  photos of their last two predecessors after this  we do have the screen resolution on those displays  and because they are both different sizes  the iphone 14 pro has a resolution of 2556  by 1179 whereas the iphone 14 pro max has  a resolution of 2796 by 1290 but the aspect  ratio for both these phones is 16 by nine then for  the actual pixels per inch if you wanted to know  for both these phones or the ppi they're exactly  the same it's 460 pixels per inch so the clarity  of the picture on both these phones are exactly  the same as both as sharp as each other then  after this we have the refresh rate so this year  with the iphone 14 pro and the 14 pro max we got  upgrades to the pro motion display last year  with the 13 pro and the pro max we had the  suppose we could go from 10 hertz all the way  up to 120 hertz but this time we can go all the  way down to one hertz and all the way up to 120  hertz and that one hertz allows us to do that  always on display that apple featured and showed  us and that's also available on both these phones  the display protection is that ceramic shield  technology that we've had since the iphone 12  and that's applied to both the 14 pro and  the 14 pro max then the actual processor the  chipset in both of these phones are identical  as well it's the a16 bionic and that's made up  of four efficiency cores two performance core  and a five core gpu and also a 16 core neural  engine but also must mention as well the a16 is  not that much more powerful than the a15 at all  but the main difference is it's made on a four  nanometer die the a16 over a five nanometer dial  what the a15 had and because of that it's actually  more efficient transistors are more smaller  inside the chipset so you should be able to get  better battery life with this however the actual  ram has also stayed the same as well as the  last generation where we had six gigabytes but  the actual type of ram has changed we've got lp  ddr5 for both of these iphones this time and this  is up over the lp ddr4 x that we had last time so  that ram is faster to access from the actual foam  then moving on to storage amounts this again  hasn't changed since the iphone 13 pro max  so we actually have storage of 128 gigabytes 256  gigabytes 512 gigabytes and one terabyte exactly  the same for both the models and like i said  the same for the 13 pro max and also the 13 pro  there is no expansional storage because  this is an iphone so you're not going to get  any of that then moving on to the actual operating  system both of these iphones can run apple ios 16  and there's a lot of new features that we've seen  we've got that car crash detection we've also got  that new dynamic island as well and the features  around that with it and we've also got some other  new features as well we've got the new sort of  lock screen update and other bits and pieces  that we've seen at wwdc and both of these phones  can run exactly the same type of software on them  then the battery size is next and there is a  difference here and the main reason is it's  because the iphone 14 pro is smaller it's a  6.1 inch display whereas the iphone 14 pro max  is a 6.7 inch display so obviously it's  gonna have a smaller battery inside it  so the iphone 14 pro comes with a 3 200 milliamp  battery whereas the iphone 14 pro max has a 4 323  milliamp battery now don't get me wrong the iphone  14 pro battery life will be a little bit less but  not a lot to be deadly honest whereas the iphone  14 pro max say for example might be on say 25  battery left the comparison of the iphone 14 pro  might have say about seven percent left so there  is a bit of a difference but at your day that's  what you get with a smaller screen phone but  iphones are the pioneer in giving the best battery  life out there so i wouldn't worry too much at the  iphone 14 pro model it's going to run out of  juice quickly then we actually have the wired  and wireless charging this hasn't changed again  since the iphone 12 models we have the lightning  connector that gives us 20 watts for both these  phones and then we also have magsafe charging  what is up to 15 watts obviously the iphone  14 pro because that's a smaller battery can  charge quicker than the iphone 14 pro max in the  sense that the battery will fill up faster than  the 14 pro max because it is larger after this we  have the weight the iphone 14 pro comes in at 206  grams whereas the iphone 14 pro max comes in at  240 grams and again this is understandable because  the iphone 14 pro is smaller in size then water  resistance both these phones are exactly the same  they're ip68 six meters up to 30 minutes in clear  water so if you do drop it into a clear water lake  you've got 30 minutes to rescue your phone  but it's up to you if you want to try this out  then we've got ports so the ports on the bottom  of these phones and there's only one of them it's  a lightning port and this is how you charge your  phone and transfer data and other things too like  carplay and this is the only port on the iphone  there's no headphone jack there's no usbc but  that might be coming next year with the iphone  15 but i have to say but it is just lightning  on both of these phones then we have the speakers  both the phones have stereo speakers and they're  exactly the same type of speakers inside and  they're really really good they're jewel of them  and then we've got 5g capability of both of these  phones but the difference is they do have that  brand new 10 gigabit modem inside and that's if  your cellular tower your provider can provide that  and also you've got a clear signal to that  that you'll be able to get those full potential  speeds then we've got bluetooth it has been  upgraded this year we did that bluetooth 5.0  for the last couple of years but we've now got  bluetooth 5.3 which gives us a few extra features  the rear cameras as well for both these phones  have been upgraded over last year's model  but they're exactly the same for both  of them so we have a 48 megapixel  wide lens we have a 12 megapixel ultra wide 12  megapixel telephoto they can both record up to 4k  and they both have a lidar sensor there is no  difference in the camera here whatsoever and  that also goes on to the actual rear camera  features as we said it's a triple lens setup  but it's quad tone five times digital zoom two  and three times optical zoom but obviously if  you mix up with the digital zoom that's up to 15  times you've got night mode deep fusion smart hdr  free then you've got apple pro raw apple  prores and 30 frames per second cinematic 2  next of all we've got the front of the phone and  the selfie camera and there is a difference again  from last year's model we've got a 12 megapixel  but it's a 1.9 aperture but it can record up to  4k and for the first time ever on a front-facing  camera on an iphone we do actually have autofocus  then the price is next the price is different  a little bit between these phones but in  america right now there's a hundred dollar price  difference if you go for the 14 pro to the 14 pro  max and that's for the base 128 gigabyte model of  course in other countries around the world it is a  little bit more deer in this and the difference is  a little bit more in comparison to each other then  we've actually got the colors both these iphones  because they're both the pro range offer exactly  the same color range so we've got silver space  black gold and we've got that new deep purple  and we've got a demo here of the gold and space  purple so what iphone model will you be buying so  you can see then guys over the iphone 13 pro max  there are a lot of extra specs inside them and to  be honest they're very similar as you can see the  only main difference is got to be a bigger battery  and also it's got to be a larger screen too but  basically both of the phones are almost identical  in features wise as you can see right here and  they're both great phones so it's up to you what  you want to choose and on that note guys it's also  time to wrap up this video so if you have enjoyed  watching it please do press the like button  and also if you want to hear the latest apple  news reviews and comparisons like this one then

XiELwdNk3ak,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,hi everyone Aaron here for zollotech and this  is the iPhone 14 pro Max we'll go ahead and  unbox it set it up and take a first look and  this year it comes in four different colors we  have purple which I have here as well as a new  space black then we have silver and gold just  like we've had for many years now it starts  at the same price as last year in the USA at  1099 and goes up to 1599 and that will get you  128 gigabytes all the way up to one terabyte  depending on the size that you pick now let's  go ahead and unbox this so here is the iPhone  14 pro Max and as you see if we flip it over it  says iPhone 14 pro Max and this is actually the  256 gigabyte variant so let's go ahead and  open it up that's more than enough storage  for me personally but let's pull off these pull  tabs here and we'll switch over to the other onethere we go and let's open the box up now I  typically use about half of the storage so  let's open this up and you can see this is  the purple color and this is the new purple  unfortunately the space black just wasn't  available although I wanted to try that  one as well but you can see the purple let's  take this out for just a moment set it aside  and let's take a look at what's in the box so  it looks pretty typical what we had last year  although in the United States we only have esim  options so we have a little pamphlet that says  you no longer need a physical Sim activate your  e-sim during iPhone setup for more information go  to apple.com esim of course we have our normal  warranty information and then an apple sticker  Unfortunately they don't match the colors of the  Apple sticker inside of course we also get them  cable so we have a USBC to lightning cable so  typically what we get every year so far no USBC  now if you need a charger to go along with your  iPhone that's where my channel partner comes in  who sponsored this video anchor if you're looking  for an AC adapter for your iPhone the anchor Nano  3 is 70 smaller than Apple's 30 watch charger  it features gallium nitride technology and a  foldable plug to reduce the size and increase its  efficiency but it can still output 30 Watts so you  can charge more devices including your iPhone  iPad Apple watch and MacBook Air all with one  charger there's five fresh finishes to match your  style Aurora white Phantom black misty blue lilac  purple and natural green anchor also has a new  541 USBC to lightning and 543 USBC to USBC cable  that are the first to use bio-based materials  in a cable anchor is the first company to use  renewable materials including sugar cane and corn  to construct the exterior of the cables and the  cables have been proven in a lab to withstand up  to twenty thousand bends making it more durable  than your typical tpe based cables I'll leave a  link to both of them in the description so you  can check them out now let's go ahead and  take the cover off the front of the phonewe'll take a look around the phone and of course  it looks pretty familiar but we do have that cut  out here which originally we called the pill and  hole punch but they're calling Dynamic Island so  in the front at the top you'll see the speakers  just above that and then of course on the left  hand side we have our silent switch and volume  buttons a couple different antenna lines around  the bottom it looks pretty familiar we've got  our microphones our lightning port and then our  speaker and then also we've got our millimeter  wave antenna at least in the United States and  then a power sleep wake button no SIM card tray on  top there's nothing there just a couple couple of  different antenna lines and then of course our  cameras and the camera bumps are even bigger  this year to compare with the previous generation  you'll see here here's the 13 Pro Max and they've  actually moved the power sleep wake button down a  little bit the camera bumps significantly larger  as you can see there side by side so definitely  a difference there and then on the other side  not really too much of a difference but Tech  technically they've moved the silent switch a  little bit down and the volume buttons down a  little bit but otherwise it's pretty much the  exact same now let's go ahead and turn it on now  the display this year is the same sort of 6.7 inch  display at a higher resolution so it's 2796 by  1290 at 460 pixels per inch it's also the same  weight so before I turn it on here the weight is  pretty much the exact same however in ounces it's  .01 ounces more in grams it's the same so 8.47  ounces 240 grams let's go ahead and turn it on  so we'll give it just a moment to turn on here  there we go and let's see what we get we'll have  to transfer that esim to this since we only have  that option here in the US now it says hello I'll  slide up I'll select my language and I'll bring  in my other phone right next to it so we'll bring  in the other phone and then it wants to pair to  my phone so we'll hit continue and then we'll  use its sort of QR code it's sort of a different  digital look there we go we'll bring it up here  it recognizes it and then it says getting things  ready so we'll give it just a moment and that  screen is super bright hopefully it dims there  we go and now it says who will be using this  phone you can set this iPhone up for yourself or  a child in your family so you'll see here it's me  or my son we'll go ahead and hit continue you  could create a new child account and then it's  going to enter ask you to enter the passcode of  the phone that you were using before so I'll do  that so we'll give it a moment to activate and  now it's asking us if we want to set up an e-sim  and you'll see here it's actually talking about  an esim allows us to conveniently and securely  move across but now we can transfer from another  iPhone from one to the other or set it up later  but we'll transfer we'll tap on transfer number  so you'll see it gives us the option to transfer  and it says it will stop working on your other  phone so we'll go ahead and tap on transfer number  and let's see what happens it says confirm  transfer on your other phone follow the  instructions so we'll see what happens here it  may take a moment and you'll see it says confirm  transfer so it's sort of a face ID unlock we'll  double click and then it says confirm transfer and  it should transfer on the other phone so now it's  saying set up esim still we'll give it a moment  to finish and see what happens at the bottom  it actually says activating so let's see what  changes here now it actually says connecting to  network so again it may still take a few momentsand now it says cellular setup complete  so that's all there is to it I guess to  move from one to the other it deactivates  the physical SIM card though which is a  bit unfortunate so now we can tap on continue  now we'll set up face ID so we'll hit continue  and it says how to set it up we know how to  set it up if you've ever used it although  it does look a little bit different  it came down from the dynamic Island  positioning my face we'll try here there we  go we'll move our face around get it set up  okay it's initialized and then it says  do you want to use face ID with a mask  if we ever need to in the future it will  be here it'll just scan our face againand then we'll move our face around in  the frame and we're done so you'll see  that came from the dynamic Island  up at the top we'll tap continue  and now we're going to transfer our data now  we can download from iCloud or we can transfer  directly from another phone this could depend  on whether or not you have a beta on your phone  whether or not which one you have to use if you  have a beta this is going to have an older version  on it so if you're running iOS 16.1 betas on your  current phone you'll need to install this update  then go back and transfer everything although  it will give you the option during setup so  we'll transfer from iPhone we'll hit agree and it  says make this your new phone we'll hit continue  and then keep your phone up to date now  it says iMessage and FaceTime people can  contact you on your devices with imessage  and FaceTime we'll go ahead and hit continueand now because it knows we're in the  beta program it's asking us if we want  to continue to take part in that because if we  have to do a direct transfer he'll need to be  updated to it if you don't continue you can just  download an iCloud backup so we'll hit continue  then it's talking about emergency SOS press  and hold for emergency SOS we also have crash  detection this time around with new sensors and  then also via satellite coming in Fall 2022 so  that's something that will be available in a  few different regions we'll hit continue and now  we'll have to update to iOS 16. it comes with a  different version pre-installed so we'll download  and install we'll hit agree as we're waiting  for the software update to install let's talk  about the specs a little bit now the display as  I mentioned earlier is slightly higher resolution  but it's also brighter so it's 120 hertz Pro  motion a thousand nits of brightness typically  1600 Peak brightness in HDR and 2000 nits in Peak  brightness Outdoors so that's something that's all  new and super bright it also has ceramic shield  and haptic touch then internally we have an a16  bionic chipset a six core CPU with two performance  cores and four efficiency cores a five core GPU  and a 16 core neural engine and we believe six  gigabytes of RAM we can check that a little  bit later when it comes to the cameras they're  all new both front and back the front camera is  a 12 megapixel F 1.9 and now has autofocus so  that's been updated and then the rear cameras  we have a 48 megapixel camera with sensor shift  stabilization and updated version of that with  an F 1.78 aperture we also have two additional  12 megapixel cameras a wide a telephoto and an  ultra wide with the telephoto we have an F 2.8  and the ultrawide is an F 2.2 of course we have  apple Pro raw three times optical zoom up to  six times digital zoom and then 4K Dolby Vision  HDR is 60 frames per second we have a new action  mode and a new cinematic mode and a new photonic  engine algorithm for the photos Also the battery  is 4323 milliamp hours and should last about an  hour longer according to Apple but we'll have to  wait and see it's ip68 this year just like last  year at six meters for up to 30 minutes has 5G  and is available for most carriers and no CDMA  support this year it does have Wi-Fi 6 not 6E  802.11 ax and also Bluetooth 5.3 now let's see  if we can wait for this to set up and then we'll  continue now you can see everything is restoring  let's go ahead and turn on dark mode here and this  is going to take a while for everything to restore  but if we go into our settings you'll see it says  ReStore in progress and let's go in and take a  look at the wallpaper so we'll go under wallpaper  we'll go to add new wallpaper and you can see some  new collections here so this is the new options  with iOS 16 but just for this phone so we have  deep purple we also have gold silver and space  black so if we want to pick the one that goes with  this phone we can do that we'll add some widgets  here we'll just add this one and just a couple  for now I'll change these later change the font  maybe change to the weather like I normally like  and there we go we'll hit add to the home screen  and hit done so now we have the new wallpaper now  of course let's see what this Dynamic island is  like so if we go into music you'll see here maybe  I'll just select a song we'll drop the volume down  and so if the song is playing we'll just swipe up  and it goes up to the dynamic Island the album art  is there and then you can see this here if I tap  on it it brings us back but to get to the widget  you have to press and hold this seems a little bit  counterintuitive so let's go back Play the song  swipe home press and hold and now we're in the  dynamic Island I wish it was just a tap to bring  this up I've heard others complain about this it  does look pretty good though so if we do that and  then let's lock the phone we'll unlock via face ID  and you'll see the island shrinks now it's also  an always on display so this is what it looks like  it's not very dim it's similar to what you have  with an Apple Watch so that looks a little bit  brighter than many would expect but it does look  pretty good it's the best always on display as far  as the information at least from what I think  I've used the different Android phones with it  and it looks pretty good although this does need  to update a little bit and as widgets get added  it will get better also in some other reviews  I saw that the always on display was really  noticeable as though you thought your phone was  on I think that's definitely true I noticed that  just while filming this video so it seems like it  doesn't go dim enough maybe we have an option we  can turn it off though if we want to so if we  unlock our phone here we've unlocked and it's  this Dynamic Island looks pretty good but it does  look a little different in sunlight too so again  let me know what you think of that now also with  the dynamic Island I can't wait for more apps to  use this and it will actually split it depending  on the apps you're using so if we go back in and  start a timer then we go into to music and play  a song swipe home you'll see it actually splits  the dynamic Island into the music on the left  with the album art and then the timer on the  right if you've got a pro Max I'm not sure what  I think about having to tap the top of the screen  all the time but it does seem like it's something  that should be very helpful so if we cancel this  swipe home you'll see the dynamic Island changes  the music is playing and then again if we tap in  it and then actually close it it goes away so it's  kind of neat to see that overall and I didn't turn  on the battery percentage but that's what it  looks like here basically what we had with the  update to iOS 16 many people suspected it would be  a little bit different now with this display comes  pwm since it's an OLED let's see how bad it is as  I really had no issues on the previous iPhone so  let's see it under slow-mo just to see what it's  like now the display is at about half brightness  let's go to our phone and see what it looks like  in slow-mo and as you can see the display should  be flickering a little bit although I can't see  it here but when you play it back in slow motion  you can but typically they're high enough and  we normally have what we have with the latest  iPhones which seems to be DC dimming so I really  had no issues with them bothering my eyes let's  see if we have geekbench we do have that installed  so let's see how much RAM we have for sure we'll  give it just a moment and then we'll check a few  more things so it looks like we do have about six  gigabytes of RAM it says 5.49 gigabytes as far as  magnets in the back I would expect it to be the  same but let's take a look so here's some magnet  paper we have that magnet Ring Of course as we  would expect and on the front you'll see some here  there's some magnetic areas here and there so not  a whole lot going on mostly where the speaker is  and the magnets on the back like you would expect  now as far as the display let's take a look  at this because this should be the brightest  display on any phone so if we go up to the top  brightness that should be a thousand nits so it  won't look right in the camera here and then  let's go outside and see what this looks like  under sunlight and see if it's easier to see I'm  betting that it is at 2000 nits now you can't see  the lines with your eyes that's because of pwm but  it's plenty bright in sunlight now something else  I wanted to test that many people asked about is  since I record videos in 18 by nine aspect ratios  they're a little bit wider than normal if we go  into YouTube Here's my iOS 16 video you can see  here that it actually does cut into the dynamic  Island quite a bit so you'll see that in my video  so maybe I should change them back to regular  resolution but if you expand past that of course  it goes around the dynamic Island so that's  something to keep in mind it's a little bit  different this year with that so let me know what  you think about that in the comments below Also  let's take a listen to the speakers they should  be about the same but let's listen to them anywayso there's not really any perceptible difference  in sound at least to my ears from the 13 Pro Max  speakers overall now the cameras get an update  this year like I mentioned before and if we go  into our settings and then formats you'll see  that we actually have Pro raw resolution at 48  megapixels so we have the option to change this  to 12 megapixels or use 48 megapixels where it's  actually using 4 pixels per one and then combining  them down to 12 megapixels so you see that a lot  but if you want full raw you can do that if we go  into the camera itself you'll see we have some new  options here so we have a two-time zoom which is  actually just punching into the sensor but that's  how a lot of these cameras work these days go to  three times and then you can zoom in further back  out to 1x then also you'll see here we have under  our video mode we have a new Mode called action  mode so if we go into our settings in the top  you'll see action mode so we can turn that on  and off if we'd like so action mode is something  that should work really nice but it's not 4K  because it uses some of that footage to fix the  stabilization and then also this year in cinematic  mode we have 4k24 and 4K 30 options so try that  again it's not changing so it may be a bug in the  software let's see if we can get that to change  there we go it's a little bit of a bug there  but 4K 24 4K 30. so it didn't respond for just a  second for whatever reason but now it's working  so we'll take a closer look at the cameras  in the full review of course and the back  of the phone is quite warm from doing all the  processing so it's still quite hot processing  in the background installing all my apps and so  that's everything with the iPhone 14 pro Max of  course I'll have to review it for the next few  days and this is actually being recorded from the  forward-facing camera on the 14 pro Max so this  is without a microphone or anything else and I  wanted to have you here and see what it's like  just put it in video mode 4K 30 hit record let  me know what you think about that in the comments  below also if you've picked up an iPhone 14 I'd  love to hear from you there as well and if you  haven't subscribed already please subscribe and  if you enjoyed the video please give it a like as  always thanks for watching I'll see you next time
01TmYuEb98I,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,Vadim and I have been using and testingthe iPhone 14s for close to two weeksnow and although the 14 pro Max is byfar my favorite iPhone and I highlyrecommend it to anybody wanting toupgrade there are still some softwareand Hardware limitations that you shouldbe aware of before buying so I'm goingto be discussing those in this video aswell as some solutions to some of theproblems so let's get right into it thefirst one is battery life the last fewyears iPhones have been amazing withbattery life but unfortunately this yearit is different now I ignored thebattery life the first few days since Iwas using it so much but I was shockedon my first normal use date when my 14pro Max was at 18 battery before 4 30 PMI hope that it would get better thefollowing week but nope and evenAngelica commented that this pastweekend she was having a top off for 14pro each day before the day was over nowthis is because of a few new featuresthat are nice but kill the battery andthankfully there are a few adjustmentsthat can be made to help which I'llshare after the next few problems thesecond is the display brightness now Ilove that it gets super bright outdoorsand that's very helpful but as I wasshooting videos from my insanelydetailed camera comparison between the14 the 13 and 12 Pro Max by the way makesure you guys are subscribed so you guysdon't miss that I noticed that the 14series consistently chooses a higherauto brightness than the rest of theolder phones and in my regular use Ikept having to manually turn it down inthe evenings this might be because Appleadded a second ambient light sensorwhich is now in the back and it'shelpful since it will bump up thebrightness if you have the Sun orsomething else that is bright behind itwhereas the 13s and older wouldn't but Iwould still love to have an autobrightness preference adjustment in thesettings third is the always-on displaywhich I also love and I talked about howmuch better it was than Samsung's but Ikeep finding it too bright in manyscenarios making it look like the phoneis on now the phone does automaticallyadjust the brightness of the always ondisplay but just like the regular screenbrightness it biases too bright and andof course all of these are leading toworse battery life so here are some workrounds while we still don't have a wayto adjust the auto brightness one thingyou could do is to use manual brightnessfor the times that you don't need thesuper crazy 2000 nits that really drainsyour battery so the manual won't allowthat the only thing is that unlikeAndroid it has a pain to find a settingon an iPhone but what I did was useshortcuts to create a link workaroundand I placed that shortcut on my homepage that automatically opens thesettings so I can quickly adjust thatfor the always-on display instead ofjust turning it off like some have Icreated a custom Focus mode wherenothing is changed other than dimmingthe lock screen super dark while stillshowing off my nice wallpaper when Iraise it this will save battery lifewhile still showing widgets andnotifications and if you want to takethis further I change the text and theicons colors to Red which is the colorthat has the lowest power usage for OLEDdisplays and it still pops with thescreen dimming mode if you want to goeven further set your lock screen to afull black image so maybe Samsung wasright with their always on since we'retalking about battery life we shouldcover Chargers now everybody knows Appleno longer gives you a charger in the boxbut that is not the problem what is isthe fact that they recommend their own20 watt Apple charging brick even thoughthe new 14 pro accepts up to 28 watts ofcharging and runs at 25 and 26 and themax runs at 27 peaking at 29. so ifyou're gonna buy one make sure to buy a30 watt model so we'll charge faster andbe more future proof even on regulariPhones thankfully bass has partnered upwith us to show off their new 30 wattsuper PSI Pro quick Chargers whichsupport full speed PD fast charging withenhanced temperature control but theyalso come with an additional USB type aport for broad compatibility as well asfoldable prongs that make it much morecompact than Apple's version not onlythat but they've also got their Adaminto 10 000 milliamp hour Palm sizepower bank which literally has threetimes the battery capacity of the iPhone114 Pro and also supports full speed PD30 watt fast charging just like theSuper Side Pro on top of that it comeswith a high quality metal casing fordurability as well as a convenientdisplay to check how much battery hasleft and it gets two extra USB type Aports so you can charge three devices atonce and the power bank itself has fastcharging capability as well and can befully charged in 2 hours and 45 minutesso go ahead and check out this basischarger and the power bank by usinglinks in the video description below thenext one is screen dimming we talkedabout this a lot with the iPhone 12 prosand pro Max's the 13s and with the 14sit has gotten a lot better but what Ihave found is that the iPhone 14 proactually dims more so than the 14 proMax and that makes sense because it's asmaller body so the heat has less areato expand to and that is just a littlebit annoying because it's still there soif you don't want to deal with screendimming if you want the ultimatebrightness outside if you're gonna dostuff like drones I would suggest go forthe 14 pro Max the next one is esim nowI've mentioned this before how it sucksthat Apple did this in some countriesand that even though it was easy toswitch over to esim I still had someissues with some calls not comingthrough I had some weird pop-ups andthen the last couple days my wife istrying to send me texts and images andit just wasn't coming through I wishthat Apple stuck with the SIM modelseverywhere because there's just an emptyspace where the Sim used to be in thesephones and I know some people straightup didn't buy a new iPhone 14 becausetheir carrier did not support it so theybought a 13 series phone instead and nowI want to switch over to the camerasbecause we do have some issues and Ialso have some workarounds with you nowthe first I want to talk about is videothis phone is amazing at shooting videohas the new action mode The Cinematicmode is a lot better but what Apple didnot give us is 8k video now when we hadthe league weeks of a 48 megapixelcamera coming to the iPhone 14 pro andpro Max we thought that was because of8K video that is because this sensor isperfect for shooting 8K video withouthaving a big crop like you get with theSamsung phones but unfortunately Appledidn't give it to us and I think thatthis is just an excuse to add it nextyear while giving you a good reason toupgrade now if you don't believe theapple is just holding this back think oflast year with the iPhone 13 Serieswhere cinematic mode could only shoot1080p without hdrs limited to 30 FPS wethought that this was a hardwarelimitation but now with the iPhone 14this thing does the 4K HDR cinematicmode even though it uses the same cameraas the 13 Pro and the same processor soit is not a harder limitation but asoftware and even though it came out nowwith the same Hardware apple is notadding it as a software update to the 13Pro phone so that is just them gettingyou to upgrade now I know some peoplesay why do you even need 8K video wellyou can say the same thing with 4K oreven 1080p before that personally if thehardware is capable I would rather havethe best resolution possible so that 5years 10 years from now when I have uhfootage of my kids places we go I havethe best quality possible and now let'sswitch over to photos Apple's reallyhyping up the 48 megapixel sensor allthe detail that you'll get from it butthe problem is if you're just takingregular photos and they're using theirquad Bayer technology the photos don'tlook any more detailed than the iPhone13 Pro photos at least in most lightingconditions that's because apple iscompressing all of those to 12megapixels and they're recording in heicand the detail just isn't there now whenwe switch over to Apple 48 megapixel Proraw it looks so much better in everysingle way but the problem is that thefile sizes go from around two to threemegabytes to around 75 they are massiveand apple doesn't give us an option tomake small files that are compressed notraw like Samsung does and even worse isthat there is no easy way to convertthese huge files into compressed onesthat are going to be roughly three fourtimes larger than the 12 megapixel onesonline Apple says that's going to takeup a lot of storage so you'll probablywant to upgrade your phone to morestorage or their option is to save toiCloud and then download and then it'sgoing to eat up your iCloud space andyour data and of course they have a linkjust to bring you to getting iCloud orupgrading your storage now I searchedeverywhere how to do this and theeasiest way if you can believe it is toedit the photo first then upload to yourfiles app let it upload to the cloud andthen you take that re-download it sendit to photos that will convert it andthat'll make the file size roughlyaround 16 or so megabytes instead ofbeing 75. thankfully the quality of thatfile is very similar to the raw file alittle bit more compression a little bitsharper but that just saves so muchspace now if you don't like doing thismethod and having to find the photodelete the old one you can actuallydownload the Highlight app which is apaid app and that will allow you to takephotos right away in that convertedformat it's about 15 megabytes it's HACso it's higher quality and it looksslightly better than the converted filesthemselves and even slightly sharperthan Apple's Pro raw file now know thisvideo is not sponsored by halide but Ijust thought it was really cool thatyou're able to do that and with thatthey even have options to add widgets toyour lock screen so you can quick openthat app for those images when you wantthat detail or even jump into the ultrawide the regular the telephoto mode soit's definitely a cool app but you dohave to pay for it now the next one iskind of tied into this and that is thefact that the lightning Port is stillhere and even worse it is still USB 2.0which is insanely slow the old SamsungS8 plus was USB 3.1 and when I wastransferring these huge Pro raw files tooffload them I was getting around 20 25megabytes per second transfer speedsinstead of what could be about 400 450and we have shown you guys that thestorage that is in here is insanely fasteven faster than the fast ones last yearso it's more than capable but apple isjust limiting it probably because theywant to bring USB type-c next year oreven Thunderbolts and make it a muchbigger deal and lastly I have this verysimple one but I keep running into thisissue and that's the fact that the Erpspeaker no longer has a grill rightthere at the glass and because of thatstuff keeps jamming into there and it'sa pain to clean out because the slit isvery small so what I found as a solutionis to have a can of air and that's theeasiest way to blow all that stuff lintwhatever out of there and to keep itclean and of course sounding its best sothere you guys go those are my top 10problems with this phone after using itfor close to two weeks hopefully all thesolutions that I gave you guys helpedyou guys out click above to subscribethere if you guys want to see myultimate camera comparison with the pasttwo generations and then this new onecheck out that video right over therethat's been Max and I'll see you in thenext one[Music]
vh-jmvepDwA,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,do you want to literally diebuy an android thenseriously that's the takeaway of today'sapple event if you go to work eat foodhike drive a car or ovulate without anapple watch ultra and an iphone 14 youare as good as deadat least i'm pretty sure that's whatapple wanted to be the takeaway of theirevent todaybehind their appeals to worrywarts andhelicopter parents though is somegenuinely cool tech and of course abunch of stuff that everyone else hashad for years that apple has slapped anew name on and called it revolutionaryso what tech here is actually a stepforward and what's just a shiny newlabellet's have a look at this segway to oursponsor cablemod cablemod's new keyboardcable configurator say that five timesfast is the easy way to complete yourkeyboard look customize almost anythingand receive your handmade cable in twoweeks or less check it out at the linkbelow[Music]in past years apple has shied away fromcalling attention to the notch to thepoint where they got sued over it butfor the iphone 14 pro the notch is onfull display now it's pill-shaped andapple calls it the dynamic islandaround the front sensors the pillexpands to show you useful informationwhile you're in other apps things liketimers music sports scores flightinformation maps navigation and more cango up here i will personally need toactually use it for a bit before idecide if it's a gimmick or not but whati know now is that it still looks badwhile watching full screen videoand it also pretty much guarantees thatyou're going to have fingerprints allover your front facing camera every timeyou go to use it which is too badbecause the front-facing camera now hasautofocus which is pretty sweetas far as i can tell this is the firsttime a front-facing camera has been ableto properly focus typically frontcameras have a fixed lens that isfocused at roughly an arm's length awaywith everything else being i don't knowprobably good enoughthis saves on the space that's needed tohave a movable focusing element butcompletely eliminates any chance ofnatural bokehboth the base and pro iphone 14 modelsthen now do have this feature andthere's a good chance that these newfront-facing cameras will be better thanmany of the rear shooters from a coupleof years ago on that subject around backon the iphone 14 pro we get a new 48megapixel quad pixel sensor that is 65larger and has a cool trick up itssleeve pixel binningwhen there's heaps of light you get thefull 48 megapixels but in low light theiphone 14 pro is able to take fourpixels and turn them into a singlebetter pixel this does decrease theresolution of your photos from 48 to 12megapixelsbut it dramatically improves low lightperformance to be clear this technologyis nothing new for instance the samsunggalaxy s21 ultra and s22 ultra have aversion of this that actually combinesnine pixels together but it is a verywelcome addition to the iphone 14 proalong with the main camera on the pro weget a 12 megapixel 48 millimetertelephoto and a 12 megapixel 13millimeter wide and every iphone 14camera benefits from apple's newphotonic engine which is basically theirdeep fusion photo aibut more better and apparently it cannearly double their low lightperformance while the base iphone 14gets the same a15 chip from the oldiphone 13 pro the 14 pro gets a fancynew a16 chip the a-16 sounds similar tothe a15 we still get two performancecores four efficiency cores and five gpucores but through the magic of fournanometer it's able to reduce powerconsumption on the performance cores by20according to apple this is the mostefficient mobile cpu in existenceand given that they've been crapping oneveryone else in terms of performancei'd say that's probably accurate andit's probably more power than you'll beneeding in a smartphone for quite sometime unless you're a very heavy userthe biggest advancement with the a16though is the display engine whichbrings better anti-aliasing the abilityto reduce the screen refresh rate downto one hertz to boost battery life andfinally and always on display for theiphonei know i know everyone on androidtotally floored right now that applehasn't had an always-on display untilnow but guyscreditcredit where credit is due they havefinally done it only took them nineyearsthree times as long as it took us todesign our screwdriver which isavailable at lttstore.combut apple giveth and apple take it awayin this case take a thing the sim trayactually in most of the world you'll geta nano sim tray but if you buy an iphone14 in north america you do not insteadyou get two e-simsnow for the vast majority of users thisabsence of a physical sim tray is nevergoing to be a problem you just connectyour carrier to the e-sim and you neverthink about it againbut if you're someone that regularlytravels between continents and doesn'thave a travel plan or you go placeswhere it's not supportedthenit's going to be a bit of a change seeright now if you want to change to alocal carrier when you're on the roadyou go grab a sim card put it in yourphone and you're donegoing forward with a north americaniphone 14 you're gonna have to registerthat carrier to one of your two e-simslots that assumes they even supportesim and then if you need a thirdcarrier for some reason you're gonnahave to go through the rigmarole ofremoving one of your carriers and addinganother one switching it's just a giantwhat fartanyway if there was one thing thatbrought a sparkle to apple's eye duringthe event it was the thought of youbeing in grave danger likewow they laid it on pretty thickthey do have some pretty cool technologyto show for it thoughpreviously if you wanted to connect yourcell phone directly to a saddle knightyou'd need a rod jeremy spec antenna andwell you still do if you want to have aproper conversation without involving acell towerbutthis is really cool by having an appthat shows you how to point your phonedirectly at a satellite you can managejust enough of a connection to send outan emergency message and your locationto make this easier they have a formwith typical emergency questions so allthe information a rescue team needs canbe sent at once and even if you're notin grave danger you can use this featureto send location data to your loved onesif you're the kind of person that goeson weeks-long treks across the yukon orwhatever the case may bealso integrated into the iphone 14 isnew car crash detection this isaccomplished by using an improvedgyroscope as well as a fancyaccelerometer that can measure up to256 g's at a 3 000 hertz polling rate aswell as data from the barometer and micto tell if an airbag has gone offapple apparently recorded a thousandhours of crash test data and from thatthey were able to tell what type of carcrash you've been in and automaticallyalert emergency services if you don'trespond to the promptcrash detection is also a feature on thenew apple watch ultra which franklylooks pretty sickthe case is titanium the face is asapphire crystal and you get a neworange programmable buttoni doubt the majority of apple watchultra users will ever need it tofunction as a dive computer a wayfinderor to measure the length of their stridebutin addition to those it has improvementsfor the rest of us like more batterylife the watch ultra can last for 36hours of regular use and up to 60 whenit's in low power mode it has dualfrequency gps for higher accuracy and anall red night mode that lookssick i think anthony probably put itbest when he said this is the applewatch that makes people that didn't wantan apple watch want an apple watch thestandard apple watch series 8 is largelyunchanged compared to the series 7except for two improvements that itshares with the watch ultra theaforementioned crash detection and somereally accurate thermometers one on theoutside and the other against your skinthese sensors were designed with women'shealth in mind

7qk2wsl8IFA,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,apple kind of surprised everyone withthe iphone 14 pro right i mean there hadbeen tons of rumors about the notchturning into a cutout or two cutouts butno one was expecting the dynamic islandand while it was getting clearer thatapple would have to follow the rest ofthe industry and using bigger camerasensors eventually i certainly wasn'texpecting the company to reboot theentire iphone computational photographysystem as the photonic engine there's alot of that sort of thing in the iphone14 pro apple's late to having an alwayson display but this one's way more onthan other phones in the united statesapple's going all in on esim which noone else is really doing there's a basicsatellite connectivity system whichisn't quite like anything else we'veheard about but apple's going to shipmillions of these phones the servicecoming later this yearall in all there are more beginnings ofbig ideas in the new iphone 14 pro thanwe've seen in an iphone for a long timethat's the easiest way to think aboutthe iphone 14 pro it feels like thefirst step towards a lot of new thingsfor apple and the iphone and maybe thefirst glimpse of an entirely new kind ofiphone but that doesn't mean all thesethings are perfect yet let's take a look[Music]we have to start with a dynamic islandright the name is ridiculous but it'sfun everyone's talking about it which isnot normal for a smartphone statusindicator system that's a win that'swhere i live every day but let's justagree that we're going to call it theisland and move onso the island replaces apple's notchit's where the front camera and the faceid system live since they've got to takeup some place in the front of thedisplay here's the thing about the notchthough in almost every review going backto the iphone 10 i've said hey after acouple minutes you know notice the notchthe island is different you are supposedto notice it it's located lower on thescreen than the notch and if you runyour phone in light mode like i do it'sactually a high contrast interfaceelement it's a black pill shape in themiddle of white screen it's right thereyou're going to see it especially sinceit's animating and moving all the timenow it's better in dark mode in fact iwould go so far as to say this is thefirst iphone you should definitely runin dark mode because of it so why didapple go from the notches there but youcan all but ignore it to the dynamicisland is here and you are going to payattention to it well it turns out thatover the years there have been likethree or four different status indicatorsystems added on to ios plugging in acharger or flipping the mute switchbrings up an overlay having a call inthe background puts a green pill in thecorner the maps app is a blue pillconnecting airpods is another overlaysome things like timers and musicplaying in the background haven't reallyhad status indicators at all the islandis apple's way of replacing and unifyingall those older status systems with anew home for system alerts and making itwork for things like music and the newlive activities api that's coming to ios16 later this year which will allow appsto share even more background info forthings like your flight status or asports score the simplest way ofunderstanding the island is it'sbasically a new widget system built ontop of that live activities api and thewidgets can have three views the mainview this expanded view and this ultraminimal icon when you've got two thingsgoing at once here's a list apple sentover of all the things that will supportthe island at launch before liveactivities arrives and third parties canuse it too so that's the concept theexecution is obviously where the actionis and like all first versions ofanything apple's made some choices thatreally work and some others thatso here's a big choice that really worksand it's just like purely apple one ofthe reasons that it's called the islandis that it's meant to float over therest of the system it's a layer on topof ios supposed to feel more likehardware than software almost like asecondary display that can get bigger orsmaller to get this to feel rightapple's actually using a new dynamicsubpixel anti-aliasing system that makesthe edges of the island up to threetimes crisper than all the otheranimations in ioshere's a macro shot of the individualrgb sub-pixels of the display beinganti-aliased to create a sharp edge forthe island in normal room lighting thisreally works it feels like the cutout onthe display is getting bigger andsmaller and the animations like thisdrop effect for when the island splitsin two are super fun in sunlight orbrighter light yeah you can see thecamera sensors the illusion kind of goesaway but it's still cool other big thingthat works is that moving all thesedisparate status indicators to theisland and making them worth payingattention to is actually pretty greatit's nice having call info right on thescreen it's genuinely useful having yourtimers right there making things likeairdrop and face id all show up inconsistent ways in the same place makethose things easier to understand whichis great the thing that kills me is thatin the keynote and all the ads appleshows the island is a thing that's worthinteracting with it's always moving andgoing back and forth between the mainview and the expanded view in reality itis not like that at all the island isn'ta primary interface element it sits overwhatever app you're actually using andapps are still very much the main pointof the iphonein fact tapping on the island doesn'topen that expanded view it just switchesyou back to whatever app that controlsthe widget to get the expanded view youhave to tap and holdthis feels exactly backwards to me nowapple knows i feel this way the ideaapparently is that things should be assimple as possible and going back to theapp is the simplest thingi don't know i think a tap should popopen the widget and i definitely thinkyou should at least be able to choosethis is kind of the whole tension of theisland it's much more noticeable anduseful than the notch but you're notreally supposed to interact with it it'sbackground information all thosequestions about whether you're gonna getfingerprints over the camera like wellas it stands you don't touch this thingvery much at all but because it's somuch more prominent you're looking at itall the time i'm using it with a bunchof apps that haven't been updated so itkind of covers up some content becauseit sits lower on the display so right atthis second the trade-off between hownoticeable it is and how useful it is alittle out of whack it doesn't quite doenough to always be in the way now ithink all this might change when thatlive activities api rolls out later thisyear which is the other big thing appledid right it made this system availableto third-party developers but right nowthe dynamic island feels like one ofthose things that needs a year ofrefinement and developer attentionbefore we really know how important itisthe big feature of the iphone 14 procamera system is the new 48 megapixelmain camera sensor apple's actually afew years late to this trend samsung hasused 108 megapixel sensors since 2020and google added a 50 megapixel sensorto the pixel 6 pro last yearthe basic idea is the same all around totake better photos you need to collectas much light as possible and to do thatyou need bigger pixels but at some pointmaking the pixels physically bigger getshard so instead you just add a lot morepixels and use software to group theminto giant virtual pixels this wholething is called pixel bidding and themath on apple spinning isstraightforward it uses four pixels tocreate a single virtual pixel whichmeans that 48 megapixel sensor generallyshoots 12 megapixel photosapple's also reworked its entire photoprocessing pipeline and rebranded it thephotonic engine the big change here isthat the deep fusion pixel by pixelanalysis that happens in mid and lowlight now happens earlier in the processon uncompressed data it's never reallybeen easy to see how much it's doing andwell it's the same on the iphone 14 prohonestly the 14 pro and 13 pro takereally similar photos here's verge videoproducer mario abdulkov in a really dimbar the 14 pro is a little cooler and itcaptures a tiny bit more detail at 100percentyou really have to go looking for itthese photos of mario outside lookpretty much the same but if you zoom inyou can see the 14 pro is getting a bitmore detail and it has a nicerbackground blur because of thesubstantially larger sensor this is allreally nice but in instagram sizes it isnot particularly noticeable here's thatsame photo on the pixel 6 pro by the wayyou can see it captures even more detailwith its pixel bend 50 megapixel sensoralong with a wider range of colorsthis is about as different as the pixeland the iphone have been in a few yearsthey both grab a lot of detail and havegreat low light performance but thepixel 6 pro makes very different choicesabout highlights and shadow while theiphone is way more willing to lethighlights blow out and even let somenatural vignetting creep in both ofthese photos are terrific and the oneyou prefer is entirely down tosubjective preference where the iphone14 pro falls down is really in thedetails of the processing apple's beenramping up the amount of noise reductionand sharpening over the years and the 14pro has the most aggressive sharpeningand noise reduction yet sometimes itjust looks bad this night skyline shotis kind of an over process mess comparedto the pixel compared to the samsung s22ultra the iphone is a little lesspredictable the s22 ultra consistentlyholds on to more color detail and lowlight it's not as heavy-handed with thatnoise reduction and sharpeningin bright light the differences betweenthe 14 pro and the s22 ultra are moresubtle but samsung still does a betterjob with detailin true samsung fashion though you getmuch punchier and warmer colors comparedto the more natural look of the iphone imean look at these sunset photossamsung's color ideas are sometimes froman entirely different planet but photofor photo the s22 ultra is moreconsistent with better fine detailnow apple isn't just pixel binning itssensor it's also cropping it to generatewhat it calls an optical quality 2x zoombasically it's just taking the middle 12megapixels off that 48 megapixel sensorif you shoot and pro rot the full 48megapixels and just cut out the centerof the image you'll get the same photoyou don't get the benefit of pixelbinning in 2x mode so it gets into alittle trouble in lower light situationsbut it's nice to have and it's a reallynice middle ground between the standardand the 3x telethat 2x crop is now the default forportrait mode which doesn't seem to haveimproved all that much both the s22ultra and even the regular s22 takebetter portrait photossamsung's really nailed cutting thesubject out of the background down toindividual strands of hair if 14 proisn't quite there yet you can alsoswitch the whole camera to pro raw modeand shoot in full 48 megapixel glorywhich generates massive dng filesanywhere between 50 and 80 megs each ifyou're the sort of person who wants todo this this is incredibly exciting butnormal people should probably not shoot48 megapixel photos on their phone theother big update is to video but youknow i called in the expert for that[Music]i'm just kind of having a hard timetelling the differencethe iphone 14 pro of course has greatvideo i mean colors are punchy and boldwith just the right amount of sharpnessbut all of the same could be said aboutthe iphone 13 pro and outside of a muchsharper image in low light from thetelephoto i'm not really seeing a largejump in performance between the two butapple has three gimmicks for us thisyear first there's now an active modethat is supposed to provide more stablefootage the pixel 6 pro had a similarfeature but i find that video footagefrom most flagship phones in 2022 isalready pretty stable certainly stableenough for mobile viewing so i neverused it there and i probably won't useit here second there's this sort ofsmooth zoom feature that smooths out thetransitions when you're switchingbetween lensesit's cool once you notice it but i thinkthat most folks won't notice it at alland lastly there's 4k cinematic mode itblurs the background just well enoughthat i actually found myself alwaystrying that mode first when filming avideo of a person's facewith anything else i mean plants signsforget about it it's just not that smartyetbut does it matter that it's in 4kfor me it kind of does but i'm a personwho's going to take that footage intopremiere anyone else i don't think itmatters overall though the 14 pros videois not upgrade worthy if you're comingfrom an iphone 13 pro and i think itwould have been a little bit morebeneficial if apple spent more timeattempting to get rid of all of thoselight reflections at night and you knowapple while you're at it why don't youadd a button to your native camera appthat allows you to switch between thefront-facing camera and the rear camerawhen you're filming a video i meansamsung has had this feature for as longas i can remember it's time that iphonegets it toookay back to the reviewapple's made some other big changes tothe iphone 14 pro the phone now has analways-on display mode which wellandroid phones have had always ondisplays for a long time now it's finethe display refresh drops to just onehertz and the brightness goes super lowto save battery life apple's done somereally nice work here to keep wallpapercolors accurate in the low power modebuthonestly i've been fooled into thinkingmy phone is awake one too many times andi might prefer a much simpler pixelstyle black and white clock i hope wesee some customization options here inthe future other than that the displayis slightly brighter than before it canhit a peak brightness of 1600 nits upfrom 1213 pro and in bright sunlight itcan go all the way up to 2000 nits youall know i think apple's mobile displaysare consistently the best in theindustry and it's no different here thisis the part of the video where i'dusually talk about connectivity butcan we all just admit that the 5g heightballoon basically popped like i turn itoff and just use lte because thosenetworks are less congestedsorrylet me know when the self-driving carsare doing robot surgery or whateveranyway apple's made a big move to dropsim trays from iphones united stateswhich means it's time everyone got usedto esim which lets you access mobilenetworks without needing a physical simcard you can sign up for up to eightdifferent networks on the iphone 14sit's pretty rad my iphone 14 protransferred my atm t account over for my13 right over bluetooth and i added mygoogle fi account with just a handful oftaps now it's not nearly as easy to movee-sim info from iphones to androidphones and back again and carriers arecertainly going to place some weirdolock-in games here because theircarriers andweirdo lock-in games are kind of whythey exist but being able to add newnetworks quickly and easily to yourphone also theoretically means we canall force the carriers to compete alittle more that's definitely a goodthing speaking of connectivity apple'semergency satellite connectivity systemisn't rolling out until later this yearbut alison got an early demo on theapple campus and it looks pretty slickthe system walks you through a series ofquestions to help first respondersunderstand your situation then it showsyou where to point the phone to accessthe satellite we've got way more on thatin her review of the iphone 14. speakingof allison she's also been testing theiphone 14 pro while becca and i havetested the iphone 14 pro max and allthree of us sort of feel like thebattery runs down a little bit fasterthan the 13 pro now to be fair all threeof us were running around taking lots ofphotos and videos generally testing thehell out of these phones for the pastweek but you know we test a lot ofphones like that apple says the 14 proand 14 pro max should get slightlybetter battery life than the 13 pros andyep i still got through a full day withthe 14 pro max so maybe it was just thealways on display taking a toll but it'ssomething i'll be keeping my eye on inthe futureso that's the iphone 14 pro the way i'vebeen thinking about it is that theiphone 13 pro was the culmination of alot of ideas for apple it was confidentand complete and kind of hard tocriticizethe iphone 14 pro on the other hand isthe clear beginning of lots of new ideaslike the dynamic island the new cameraeven that satellite connectivity systembecause these ideas are new they'reinherently incomplete so there's lots tocriticize but they're worth criticizingwhich is its own kind of victory and asign that apple isn't holding still withthe future of the iphone i'm into thatwhat i don't know is if all these newfeatures are worth it yet if you're thesort of person who's willing to acceptsome rough edges to be on the bleedingedge you're gonna have a lot of fun withthe iphone 14 pro you'll be figuring itout right alongside apple but foreveryone elsemight be worth holding off of here lookat these cloudsoh my godlook at thatlook at thoseoh my god this stuff over here come onthat is just so special
35BkHichD2M,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,you would think that the most expensivebest iPhone is the one with the bestbattery life rightnope this here is the new iPhone 14 plusit's basically just the iPhone 14 butbigger so the mini sized iPhone is deadafter two years and they've replaced itwith this plus size version which meansa bigger screen and a bigger battery Iwill say it is a bit lighter than you'dprobably expect that aluminum makes thisbig phone actually lighter than thesmaller Pro with its stainless steel butthere's really not that much elseinteresting here except that when Appleannounced it on stage they said that itwould be the best battery life ever inan iPhone and then they just moved on Iguess that does make sense though rightit's the same size as the iPhone 14 proMax same battery size roughly but with adimmer 60 hertz display so I guess yeahit should last longer but is it actuallysubstantially longer see when you get toApple's website the iPhone 14 pro Max isthe one listed at 29 hours of videoplayback Which is higher than this 14plus which is listed at 26 hours butthen again just for audio playback theplus will do a hundred hours for thefirst time which is more than the proMax which is just 95 hours super usefulfor those of us doing five straighthours of audio playback in airplane moderight but no that this is the firstpoint I wanted to make in this videowhich is that in the smartphone Worldthese days the benchmarks are less andless relevant than ever and I almostdon't even pay attention to them anymoreunlike back in the day when they used tobe really important like years ago newphones would come out and they wouldhave huge year-over-year performancegains which was exciting but mostlybecause they would actually like unlocknew things that you could do with yourphone things like shooting 4K video forthe first time or playing HD games ortaking HDR photos with a bunch ofdifferent exposures so that big jump inraw performance year over year meantbefore the jump you couldn't do a thingand then after the jump you crushed athreshold and now you could which wassweet but smartphones are so evolved andso complete nowadays that basicallyevery smartphone can do all thefundamental things very well it's morearound the edges that they're startingto optimize for certain tasks certainthings so yes the overall power and thegeekbench score still does go up alittle bit year over year every year butthat doesn't really mean nearly as muchas it used to it doesn't really meananything significant other than maybe afew more frames per second in a game orlaunching an app slightly faster Plus inthis one's case it's the same chip aslast year so it means almost nothing butwhat's really happening now is companiesare developing their own silicon withspecial sections of their system on achip designed to accelerate certainfunctions that they think will be apriority for their users so if Apple youknow the a series chips and the iPhonesmeans big performance cores smallefficiency cores but then a bunch ofother stuff things like a proresaccelerator for faster video encodingthere is a neural engine for optimizingmachine learning tasks and there's aspecial image signal processor forfusing to together different exposuresinto a photo very quickly and a displayengine that helps smoothly run thoseanimations for the Pro phone on thedynamic island with Google you've gotthe new tensor chip in their pixelphones again big cores small cores butthen dedicated pieces for machinelearning for their Crazy Fast speech totext there's an image signal processorfor HDR plus and then more and more someapple flagships even though they haven'tgotten to designing their own siliconentirely are still adding things like aspecialized ISP to the find X5 Pro forprocessing photos the way they want tomuch faster and now it's even startingto apply to all types of other deviceswe already know about Apple silicon Maxyou know the M1 chip having a proresaccelerator because that's important toa lot of people using Pro Max also thesteam deck has a custom Apu that lets ithit certain frame rates in lower powerStates basically the point is thesecompanies are now adding focused piecesof compute Hardware when they designproducts based on what they think is apriority to their users and acceleratethose those things dramatically andthose pieces make a bigger differencethan any Benchmark will show like herehere's this is a good analogy I like agood comparison so let's say you need avehicle for the fastest time around atrack and you get to choose betweenvehicle a and vehicle B all you get tochoose from is benchmarks so thebenchmarks for vehicle a is it did a 0to 60 in 3.5 seconds it got on a Dynoand measured 502 horsepower and 339pound-feet of torque then vehicle B didthe 0 to 60 in three seconds flat itmeasured 835 horsepower and 908pound-feet of torque so okay just basedon those numbers a sensible person wouldprobably lean towards picking vehicle Bthat would mean you just picked therivion r1t a very fast pickup truck butyou just picked that over the 2018Porsche 911 GT3 one of the best trackcars ever made that's how I feel aboutrelying on basic General benchmarksthese days like the benchmarks tell onestory about the general overallcapability but you still should bepicking based on the specific featuresand things you want to do like you wantto carry around lots of huge things getthe one with the huge trunk do you wantto make quick turns at high speeds getthe one with the arrow pieces do youwant to take lots of pictures and videosof yourself and your friends get the onewith the best cameras do you want theone with the longest possible batterylife get the big one but speaking ofbattery life I do actually want tomention that I have noticed I've gottenbetter battery life on the iPhone 14Pros after disabling the always ondisplay this is something we werewondering from the review I've had acouple days or weeks now to do it andyeah it does make a difference but thatactually leads to the second part of thevideo when I wanted to go over a littlebit more which is the state of theiPhone 14s about a month later so it'sbeen an interesting couple of weekstesting these phones and seeing what'shappening to other people with theirphones my reviews went out using thephone's Apple loans for reviews but thensince then I've gotten my own that I'vebought and started using full-time Ihaven't really had any major issues butit does seem like this has been one ofthe notably buggier launches of a newiOS and iPhone in the past couple yearsand even though it's not happening to myphones it's hard to ignore so there wasa pretty famous camera jittering bugwith the pro iPhones but for a quick iOS16.0.2 update I ironed that out the onlyissue I've personally noticed on mine ismy iPhone 14 pro often takes forever toconnect to wireless car play and oftenjust fails and doesn't connect but thenagain I can't tell if that's just thenew iOS or the Cadillac lyric that'scausing this exact problem but I askedon Twitter hey how is everyone's iPhone14 experience is going so far the firstfew weeks and of course this is going tobe a pretty focused sample but thousandsand thousands of you chimed in and I'vespent quite a while reading through alot of this stuff and it's almost alittle bit surprising how many bugs I'vebeen getting tweeted about here are thethree most frequent things that I'mseeing from you guys in my TwitterDimension so the first one is lockscreen stuff specifically uh it seemslike there's like an auto rotate bugwhen customizing your lock screen tonsof people send me screenshots of itvideos of it it hasn't happened to minebut it's been annoying because then youkind of have to reset your phone restartit and start it again but that's likethe number one thing I saw mostfrequently then number two was DynamicIsland stuff so a lot of people with thepro phones have noticed weird bugs withDynamic Island the software bubble likemoving to the wrong place or animatingweirdly getting stuck in animationsquirky stuff like that I kind ofexpected that to happen a little bit atthe beginning but that obviously kind ofbreaks the illusion of it just beingthis little seamless little pill box ofsoftware that's annoying but then numberthree is battery drain and this is theone I am most concerned about a sort ofalarming number of people just when Iasked about it it's been floating aroundthere already but people just chiming inwith like yep the battery doesn't lastas long as I expected it doesn't last aslong as a previous phone I had it's beendraining and telling me that it's beendraining and I'll like wake up in themiddle of the night and have like a warmphone with a nearly dead battery weirdstuff uh so that's the one that I'mgonna keep my eye on that I thinkApple's probably also going to be payingthe most attention to it's the hardestone to fix also shout out to channelsponsor dbrand they just dropped thisnew sick digital camo design they callit glitch camo they've also got a navyand Arctic colorway available great wayto make your iPhone stand out from therest you can check these out at the linkbelow but there you have it that's theiPhone 14 plus and the iPhones one monthlaterthanks for watchingyou guys in the next one peace[Music]
aLmA6tdGUCM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,today we have another new reveal  of the iphone 14 pro max along  with more confirmation on the specs and features!so first story of the day we've got news from mark  german who says that we could see the removal of  the sim card slot in the iphones in his latest  power on newsletter he advises that apple have  internally discussed the idea of launching iphones  without a sim slot by next year and it could even  be removed on some iphone 14 models now personally  i think it will happen eventually to free up some  internal space but not just yet there are still  a few carriers out there that don't provide easem  support so it's not a wise move until all carriers  are ready now next up we've got news that apple  have completed hardware testing for satellite  connectivity on the iphone 14. ming chi kuo  reported that all hardware tests related to the  iphone 14 satellite connectivity were complete  and this was a head of mass production and that  the feature is going to be dependent on apple  being able to settle on the business model of the  feature now of course with the new launch event  labelled far out in having a bit of a space theme  it's led to a lot of speculation that this is true  it's also being reported that users can use this  to call or text people but most likely it's just  going to be for emergencies only and not for  day-to-day activities now next up we've got news  that the pillar and the punch hole cameras on the  new iphone 14 pro models could be displayed as a  unified pill cut out it's reported that apple  are going to be using the display to create a  black space between the two and that they'll also  be adding an orange and green dot indicator for  both the microphone and the camera the indicators  will apparently be much brighter than the rest of  the display to ensure that they can be seen even  in direct sunlight and this is of course just for  privacy so that you know when they're being used  now next up we've got news from mac rumors about  the much awaited always on display they advise  from their exclusive source that the ios 16 lock  screen is going to directly interact with the 14  pro models always on display and it will integrate  with notifications widgets and wallpapers now  there's also a slight change to the status bar  on the lock screen with the signal indicator being  moved over to the left and then we then get a few  more changes with the always on display when using  the always on display the depth effect background  is going to be fully darkened then the foreground  is going to be dimmed so it can only just be seen  now widgets will also be available in the always  on display but they're going to fade in and out  at separate intervals due to fears of oled burning  now unfortunately it seems that always on display  is just going to use the same setup you've got  on the lock screen so there won't be an option  to customize two separate layouts one for the  normal and then one for the always on display  now next up we've got a new reveal of the iphone  14 pro max along with lots of fake ones that are  out there i'm constantly seeing tweets for the  iphone 14 pro and the pro max like this one just  here but these ones are 100 photoshops people  are just taking screenshots of the apple page  that's currently there and then photoshopping  some iphone 14 information as well as pictures  and pretty much the same as i've done here majin  buu has tweeted more photos of packaging for the  iphone 14 pro max from case manufacturers and  these of course confirm the new design that we  are expecting to see we've also got another new  tweet from ice universe this morning and he's  posted a hands-on video with the iphone 14 pro and  it gives us another good look at the camera sizing  now of course this is a 3d printed model but it's  created to the specifications of the cad that was  leaked very early on with pretty much all reliable  leakers and analysts of the same opinion when it  comes to the pro model's design and launch being  imminent we can be pretty sure that this is what  the iphone 14 pro and the iphone 14 pro max are  going to look like we've also got a new tweet  from tommyboy this is showcasing the new non-pro  6.7 inch iphone 14 cases and according to him and  his photos this is going to be called the iphone  14 plus and not the iphone 14 max now i've got no  idea who tommy boy is so i can't comment on his  accuracy or reliability so while it could be the  case i'd just take this with a pinch of salt for  now with launch just two days away it's going to  be the last iphone 14 leak video from me and we'll  wait for apple's launch and then cover it again in  the full review but for those interested we're now  going to run through the full specs design and the  expected pricing for every iphone 14 model we can  then check back and see how accurate they were in  two days time to start with the new entry level  model is going to be the iphone 14 with the iphone  14 we get a 6.1 inch super retina oled display  it's expected to be an 1170 by 2532 resolution and  while many sources claim it's a 90 hertz display  there is a chance that it could still be 60 hertz  on the front we'll be getting a 12 megapixel  selfie camera but unlike the pro models we will  have a notch instead of a punch hole camera on  the rear it's looking like a dual camera setup  while early rumor suggested a lidar scanner that's  unfortunately not going to be the case the dual  camera setup is going to consist of a wide angle  and an ultra wide camera and the phone is going to  be powered by the a15 bionic that we saw last year  although it will likely be modified slightly and  it may still come under an a16 model name it's  going to be coming with six gigabytes of ram  and a choice of 128 256 or 512 storage the phone  will be powered by a 3279 milliamp hour battery  with improved fast charging likely to be around 25  watts it's expected to support both wireless and  reverse wireless charging and it's also expected  to come with 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 and ultra  wideband support it will of course tip the new  ios 16 when it comes to pricing we are expecting  a slight increase due to higher component costs so  we're expecting the base model to start from 899  now next up we've got the iphone 14 pro  with the iphone 14 pro we get a 6.1 inch  pro motion oled display it's a 120 hertz ltpo  display with a resolution of 1170x2532 which  gives us 440 pixels per inch on the front we get  another 12 megapixel wide angle camera with face  id sensors embedded in the display on the rear  we get a triple camera setup consisting of a 48  megapixel wide angle as the primary a 12 megapixel  ultra wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto and of  course we get the additional lidar scanner the  phone is going to be powered up by the a16 bionic  and it's coming with a choice of six gigabytes  of ram 128 256 512 or one terabytes of storage  the phone's going to be powered up by a 3 240  milliamp hour battery with improved fast charging  likely to be 25 watts it's expected to support  both wireless and reverse wireless charging  and it's also expected to come with 5g wi-fi 6  bluetooth 5.2 and ultra wideband support it's  going to ship with ios 16 and the base model of  the iphone 14 pro is expected to start from 1099  so next up we've got the new addition which is  the iphone 14 max the iphone 14 max is expected  to come with a 6.7 inch super retina oled display  it's coming with a resolution of 1284 by 2778  while some sources are claiming it's a 90 hertz  display there is still a chance it could be a 60hz  panel on the front we get a 12 megapixel selfie  camera and on this model we also have a notch  and then on the rear we get a 12 megapixel wide  angle as the primary and another 12 megapixel  ultra wide but unfortunately there will not be  a lidar scanner the phone is going to be powered  up by last year's a15 bionic although it will be  slightly modified and they could still market it  as the a16 chipset the phone comes with six  gigabytes of ram and a choice of 128 256 or  512 gigs of internal storage the iphone 14 max is  gonna be powered by a 4 352 milliamp hour battery  again with fast charging likely to be 25 watts  it's expected to support both wireless and reverse  wireless charging and it's also going to come  with 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 and ultra wideband  support of course it's going to be shipping  with ios 16 when it comes to pricing we expect  the iphone 14 max to start from 999 now finally  we've got the top end model the iphone 14 pro max  the iphone 14 pro max is coming with a 6.7 inch  pro motion oled display we're expecting a 120hz  ltpo display with a resolution of 1284x2778 giving  us 458 pixels per inch on the front we get a 12  megapixel punch or selfie camera with face id  under the display and then on the rear is the  triple camera setup and a lidar scanner the triple  camera consists of a 48 megapixel wide angle a 12  megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto  the phone's gonna be powered by the a16 bionic  and it's coming with a choice of six gigabytes  of ram 128 256 512 or one terabytes of storage  the phone's gonna be powered up by a four thousand  three hundred and fifty two milliamp hour battery  with improved fast charging likely to be 25  watts and again it's likely to support both  wireless and reverse wireless charging  it's expected to come with 5g wi-fi 6  bluetooth 5.2 and ultra wideband support and it  will of course ship with ios 16. the base model  of the iphone 14 pro max is expected to launch  from 1199 and of course the highest storage  variants will cost more so overall the iphone 14  is looking incredible and it's great to finally  see some drastic design changes in terms of the  hardware they've already got a good setup going  so focusing on design is a good move of course  the iphone 14 series is going to be launching  in september 22 and as more and more leaks  come in i'll continue to share them as they do  as always though i'd like to know your thoughts in  the comments so who out there is excited for the  iphone 14 launch and which model you're waiting  for but thanks for watching the video if you liked  it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next oneforeign
PFv4p8fhtXY,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,So then guys it's the day we've been waiting for  it's iPhone 14 launch day and in this apple bag  here I actually have a brand new iPhone 14 pro  Max and today I'm going to be doing review of  the iPhone 14 pro Max and by doing an unboxing for  you and also I'm going to be doing a review of the  brand new Dynamic Island to see what that's about  and also other features like the always on display  I'm also going to be doing a camera review or  camera comparison of the iPhone 14 pro Max versus  the iPhone 13 Pro Max to see what the differences  are there and then last of all what I'm going to  do is I'm going to do some benchmarking as well of  some different kind of apps against the iPhone 13  Promax a15 and this brand new a16 bionic in this  iPhone 14 pro Max well without further Ado guys  let me move over to my desk and let's start with  the unboxing first of all so we have the box here  and it does look quite good actually let me just  tilt it up towards you like what Apple always do  they always show the phone from the front angle  from a side angle on their boxes so no exceptions  here it says iPhone on the side and let me just  uh flip it over here on the back it's got bits  and pieces telling you about the iPhone also we've  got some sort of like stickers to hold it together  they look kind of papery like I said iPhone  written on the side Apple logo on the bottom  and then let me just flip it around to the other  side and you've got another Apple logo there so  let's just put this back onto the table so what I  want to do is I actually want to just flip it over  we're going to actually open it up now so they've  got arrows here all these stickers to help you do  it so I'm just going to peel it off and they're  not stick around so they're kind of like papery  sort of Base cardboard that's what they feel like  if you wanted to know it's Apple's recycling plan  so we're just going to pull this off flip this  back over uh let's just see now if we can just  kind of sort of slide it open oh look at that wow  that is gorgeous little turkey at the bottom paper  tag sort of thing just to pull it open and look  at that you can see the purple here with the light  hitting on it it looks absolutely gorgeous I love  this new deep purple color it looks absolutely  amazing let's flip it over here we've got sort  of some instructions tell you where the volume  buttons are and power things like that and let's  do that pillars of charging sort of thing logo  there's just notice there for your lightning so  let's peel this off and this is the best moment  isn't it let's do it oh yeah yeah look at that  there we go all peeled off it does look amazing  I need to get my reflection here but it does look  like an iPhone 13 Pro Max a 12 Pro Max it's the  same sort of chassis but look at the purple here  is picking up my fingerprints I will say that  but let's continue on and see what else is in the  Box before we look at the iPhone some more so we  have a USB C cable here too there so you can see  there's the lightning so just stand there and then  we also have this little card instructions and a  sticker inside but oh yeah I forgot to tell you  because I've got a European model I have got a SIM  card a physical SIM card let me show you here so  if you guys in America you've only just got Easton  but we still have the physical SIM card slot you  can see it just there on our phones so there  we go a little bit of extra info so maybe next  you'll get E7 of carrier sign up but we've got  all the kind of papers the sticker unfortunately  is in white not the purple like the phone sadly  but that's quite standard for iPhones it always  has been the white Apple logo sticker got some  cards here yeah wow it's quite a few cars look  at this you can actually play cards with these  it's amazing loads of them lots of information to  read if you really really want to do that so yeah  to your heart's content in different languages  all that kind of sort of info and everything and  really I'm just going to put all of this to one  side out of the way that's just basically what's  inside the Box no charger again let's have a look  at the iPhone you can see that I've got a nice  finger smudge it is picking up my finger marks  quite easily this way look at that on the side oh  dear you've seen I've only got out the box but we  have like the power and everything silent button  on the side there I've got the power on this side  and everything but I've got his fingerprints yeah  not the best I will say that uh maybe a case will  need to be happening when I've got some info about  that in a second but there's the front you can  see the camera there and then we've also got the  face ID this is gonna be in the dynamic Island and  I'm going to power this on for the first time  now let's have a look let's see if we get the  Apple logo coming up there we go Apple logo is  powering on and for the first time an iPhone 14  pro Max let's see how long it takes now to get to  the main screen I think it's almost done already  oh no apple again there we go hello Apple  introduced us last year I really like it you  can see the dynamic Island at the top let's just  open this up select my language English and there  we go United Kingdom that's where I'm from guys if  you didn't know and there we go the iPhone's all  ready to go and that is the unboxing complete so  I've decided to skip over showing you how to set  up the iPhone for the first time because as easy  as making a peanut butter sandwich to be honest  and I've done it in previous videos it's quite  simple but the iPhone 14 pro Max oh my goodness  it does look gorgeous have a look at this look at  that I love this purple color I'm not sure if the  light's hitting it here too well but it does look  really really nice with the Apple logo we've got  the cameras the LED on the camera is definitely  a different shape and slightly bigger I can tell  the lenses are also bigger too like I did say in  the unboxing it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet  though for everything I've got the always on  display here what's always on obviously that  looks absolutely amazing I'm going to talk about  that a little bit further on in a mo but overall  compared to my iPhone 13 Pro Max as you can see  here there's there's not much difference to be  fair the main difference obviously there's a notch  on this one and this one doesn't have that it does  have that new Dynamic Island what I'll talk about  a little bit more further but looking at the the  back of them as you can see there's not much in it  the same design language the same sort of size as  well so it's not really much different in that  aspect if you're hoping for a brand new design  iPhone that's going to probably be coming next  year with the iPhone 15. so then guys just quickly  I want to talk about the sponsor of today's video  and that is case Divine now I have mentioned case  Divine many times and many sponsorships with  them because I absolutely love their cases and  guess what for the iPhone 14 pro Max that I've  just unboxed here I've actually got a case of  eye case case if I offer lots of different types  of cases out there they offer their impact case  and their impact case can be dropped at 8.2 foot  and then the ultra impact case can actually drop  from 11.5 foot and then the bounce case that you  see right here can actually be dropped from 21.3  foot and basically your phone will still survive  if you drop it from that and especially with their  brand new bounce case you've got these sort of  extra ridges on the side will actually make it  just bounce off a surface in fact I did a  little bit of a test for this check it outas you can see guys the phone is absolutely intact  and in fact case if I offers some extra bits and  pieces that you can have so I've actually got  a case device screen protector here what you  can get from them and this is now going to be  protecting the front of my iPhone 14 pro Max and  on top of this as well on the back I've actually  got sort of a camera lens sort of protector as  well and on top of that as well just to make it  even more secure the actual sort of edge of the  case is actually raised ever so slightly above the  actual lens Rings here so if you do drop it you'll  know that your camera is going to be more than  protected and you're probably wondering how case  if I make their cases so strong to be dropped  from a height well the main reason is because  they're Eco shot technology and they have tension  distribution sort of a sort of Twisted design  inside their cases as you can see right here not  only this like the bounce case I've got here it's  got six times military grade because of this  and it's also got abrasion resistance to give  even more cushioning inside the actual case  for your iPhone the other thing I love about  case divide cases is actually what the cases  are made out of case if I love to make their  case without a plan based materials and recycle  material in fact as you can see here these two  cases I'm showing off they're made from recycled  phone cases and in fact it makes up 65 off the  actual casing something else that is great about  caseify is that they offer loads of different  customizations for your needs like the ones I've  got right here but if you go onto their website  they offer even more and they're absolutely  fantastic especially they do lots of collabs with  lots of other companies too if you've also got a  magsafe charger you don't need to worry because  case defy make cases that are mag safe compatible  also if you're extra clumsy like me what you could  also get is you can get some straps up cases if  I do like this rope strap that you've got here  to attach to yourself and then also attach to your  phone just to make sure that you definitely don't  drop your phone on a like a hike or something  like that finally what case if I doing right  now because of the launch of the iPhone 4T models  they're actually actually offering 15 off all of  their cases and all you need to do is go to this  web link that I'm displaying right here will also  be in the description of my video and you can get  15 off your first case defy case so what are you  waiting for go and get one right now and with that  guys let's return back to the video but let's talk  about some of these features like I said about  the iPhone 14 pro Max and let's first of all talk  about Dynamic Island the big one so in case you  didn't know that actual sort of pill shape at the  top is called the dynamic Island and it can also  be reshaping itself into different forms and with  some apps that are compatible with it and what I  mean by this is hoping that Maps here well I've  got Maps open and if I close it down look what  happens here are you watching a dynamic Island  look see it's expanded and also can you see it's  got the navigation symbol on it and all I have  to do to go back to maps just literally tap on the  island and I'm back in maps is that amazing and so  like this move around in maps as you can see here  so it's quite cool so let me close it again do  that for you and there we go it's expanded again  so it's really really awesome but this works with  other apps too so I've opened up Spotify on my 70s  rock anthems I'm playing a bit of Queen Bohemian  Rhapsody I can't play it Loud because due to  copyright reasons but it is playing and there we  go you've got a bit of footage here but if I close  it down look at this ready and whoosh it's at the  top there it's in the dynamic Island it's really  really cool it's up there we've got the album art  we can see it's playing two and it's just playing  in the background I can just touch it again oh try  again there we go and it's opened up back into the  app it's a really cool feature to have that at the  top let's close it down again and as you can see  it's in the Island open it again that easy it's  so simple in fact I'm just gonna do it one more  time if actually I'm gonna do it from this page  look watch oh close down and reopen close down and  we're back to the home page and it's still playing  I absolutely love this new Dynamic I learned it's  awesome so the features on Dynamic are pretty cool  as you can see but let's now move over to the  always on display what's actually just come up  on my phone just there but let me show you back on  the desk and while it can do on what it looks like  so the always on display is the best I've ever  seen of an always-on display this is how you do  it properly so here we are on my main screen press  standby there we go that's always on display still  got my Bohemian Rhapsody there in the background  but that is the always on display you can see my  fingerprints on the screen there I'm going to try  and open it up again let's have a look let's even  get my face over to the actual camera let's  have a look now there we go and I'm back in  again you can't really see my fingerprints as  much now because it has lowered down the screen  but I'm going to do it again you can see here and  there's the always on display still showing some  my notification and this is running at one Hertz  I really do love this always on display this is  the way in my opinion how always on display should  really work so really that's all the sort of main  features on the front of the iPhone but the other  features that we do have is a brand new camera at  the top inside that hole punch and we've also got  the new cameras on the back and I want to talk  a little bit further about these so what I've  decided to do is I'm going to do a comparison  of the iPhone 13 Pro Max last year's model to  the iPhone 14 pro Max this year's models of the  actual sort of Photography that we're gonna get  but first all I'm going to do is I'm gonna do a  few video tests just to show you guys first of all  and like I said at the front of these phones we do  have the sort of face ID camera and this has been  changed so first of all I'm going to do the iPhone  13 Pro Max and then we'll move on to the iPhone 14  pro Max so this is a test of the iPhone 13 Pro Max  the front facing camera and how I sound with a bit  of wind noise as you can hear in the background  and obviously there's no autofocus on this so  let's switch over then to the iPhone 14 pro Max  so now on the iPhone 14 pro Max and I can tell  straight away I'm holding the phone at my arm's  length that has got a far wider picture uh the  autofocus is working really really well I've got  a bit of a bumpy road here walking and yeah it's  really really clear definitely the front-facing  camera is definitely better in my opinion than the  iPhone 13 Pro Max let me know your thoughts too  so definitely there was a difference there the  iPhone 14 pro Max front facing selfie camera  definitely gives a wider shot gives a clearer  picture in my picture I think it was a little  bit softer on the iPhone 13 Pro Max don't get  me wrong the iPhone 13 Pro Max is still giving  it a great image but that autofocus and that 1.9  aperture on the front facing camera is definitely  an improvement over the last years iPhone  13 Pro Max front facing camera and without  the way let's now move on to doing a bit of a  stabilization sort of run so what I'm going to  do now is I'm going to do a little walk on the  run with the iPhone 13 Pro Max just using the  normal camera on the back and then I'm going  to do the same on the iPhone 14 pro Max so I'm  just walking down this path here a little bit  just to see what the iPhone 13 Pro Max is like  let's pick up the pace a bit it's a bit  of a run see what the stabilization's likeso here's a stabilization test of  the iPhone 14 pro Max just going a  bit of a walk I'm going for a bit of  a run and that's what it looks likewell definitely in my opinion I think the  iPhone 14 pro Max won that the stabilization  was definitely far better wasn't jumping around  as much as the iPhone 13 Pro Max so what I want to  do next of all is I kind of want to do kind of a  landscape sort of view of where I was taking these  videos from and I'm going to do that first on the  iPhone 13 Pro Max do a bit of a zoom in using the  telephoto and now I'm going to do exactly the same  sort of video on the iPhone 14 pro Max 2. so this  is a 4K 60 frames per second test and the iPhone  13 Pro Max as you can see it's still quite clearanother thing got a bit of a distance  over let's see if we can zoom in  there we go that's the free time zoom that  is on the iPhone 13 Pro Max zooming on a  little village over there soon back out  again and there we go that's the clarity  of this phone switching over to the iPhone  14 pro Max this time and the clarity againyou can see I'm going to do a zoom in I'm  going to first we'll do a two time zoom  and now let's do a three time zoomin my opinion I think this is coming out clearer  let me know your thoughts I think again the  iPhone 14 pro Max wins here the video footage  was definitely clear especially got that extra  sort of Zoom as well we've got two time zoom  free time zoom and that was definitely really  good that's all thanks to that 48 megapixel uh  sort of lens and sensor what's in here it allows  us to do that two times Zoom but the three time  zoom telephoto was definitely better in fact I've  actually done some tests here of some photos as  well of where I was standing taking that video  so first of all standing in the same location I  decided to take some pictures on the iPhone 13 Pro  Max first of all and I did the sort of zoomed out  Ultra wide sort of camera lens photo and you can  see it right here and it's come out quite clear  and I actually do like this photo it's come out  really really well but let's then compare it then  to the iPhone 4 team pro Max sort of camera this  is the zoomed out 0.5 and to be honest I can't  really see too much difference there's a little  bit more clarity here with the iPhone 14 pro Max  but there isn't much in it but switching back then  to the iPhone 13 Pro Max lets us do a normal sort  of wide sort of camera on which 12 megapixel the  main camera and let's have a look here again it's  still quite sharp at this it's definitely probably  sharper than the ultra wide but yeah let's flick  over to the iPhone 14 pro Max and yeah there's a  lot of clarity it's definitely more sharper here  on the wide let's next of all do a three times  Zoom here on the iPhone 13 Pro Max and you can  see the difference here it's lost a little bit  more clarity but it's still very very good for  what it is but then switching over to the iPhone  14 pro Max you may have noticed it's not zoomed  in as much because this is the two time zoom  I just wanted to show this but the iPhone 13  Pro map doesn't actually have this but I just  wanted to show it but let's do the free time  zoom and as you can see here and then they'll  bring back the iPhone 13 Pro Max picture there  we go that's the 13 Pro Max flicking over to the  iPhone 14 pro Max I think the iPhone 14 pro Max  is definitely clearer and next of all let's do  that 15 time zoom this is the digital Zoom built  in iPhone 13 Pro Max and uh look at that oh it  looks like a washed out picture it looks like  like a water art sort of picture it's not very  good is it but let's look over to the iPhone 14  ProBox 15 time zoom and yeah it's a little better  but it's still not the best I think until Zoom is  not sort of Apple's best thing what they have with  their photography but they're still doing quite a  reasonable job of this and definitely I would say  the iPhone 14 pro Max has one here in videos and  photography over the iPhone 13 Pro Max but though  it's just one last category I want to show you  and that is also macro photography so I took a  picture here as you can see here we've got some  leaf and yeah the iPhone 13 Pro Max does bring it  out but then if I bring over the iPhone 14 pro Max  it blurs out the background and the iPhone 14 pro  Max brings that leaf much more into focus it is  definitely better than last year's iPhone 13 Pro  Max so cameras definitely went on the iPhone 40  Pro Max hands down there is an improvement but  what I am going to say is the iPhone 13 Pro Max  is still doing a fantastic job and it will do for  many many years to come so don't let that throw  you off if you can get a good deal on an iPhone  13 Pro Max next of all let's move on to do some  benchmarking on both of these phones so I'm going  to do a geekbench sort of uh Benchmark first we'll  see how good the a16 is over the a15 but first of  all we need to do it on the a15 chipset inside the  iPhone 13 Pro Max so let's get that started here  so as you can see I've opened up geekbench and  let's begin the test and what I've done is I've  left the test run because it takes forever to  complete and let's have a look at the final score  and let's have a look at the results here so the  single core score came in at 1722 and then the  multi-core score the multi-core score came in at  4296. so let's do the same test now on the iPhone  14 pro Max so I've got geekbench open I'm going  to start the test and it's the same thing again  guys just gotta leave this run and let's have a  look at the final results as you can see here the  single core score is better not by a huge amount  but it's definitely an improvement at 1 884 but  the multi-core is definitely better at 5365 for  the iPhone 14 pro Max and that is definitely  an improvement so after this I've decided to  do another Benchmark for you so I've decided to  complete an Anto 2 Benchmark and first of all as  you can see here doing it on the iPhone 13 Pro Max  I'm going to start this and again it takes time to  complete and let's have a look at the final score  so the final score has come in and as you can see  here it has got a whopping score of 724 145. what  to be honest is very impressive for an iPhone 13  Pro Max but let's see what the iPhone 14 pro Max  did so again I started off The Benchmark on the  iPhone 14 pro Max and everything began nicely and  the final score finally came in at 875 303 and  that is really really impressive for the iPhone  14 pro Max with that a16 chipset inside it so with  that last Benchmark complete the iPhone 14 pro  Max definitely has some upgrades on the iPhone  13 Pro Max but to be honest is it worth getting  an upgrade from a 13 Pro Max to a 14 pro Max in my  honest opinion I don't think so I do think it is a  great phone the 14 pro Max but I do remember doing  a review last year of my initial thought saying  how much better the third team Promax was over  at 12 Pro Max and then the 12 Pro Max how much  better was than the 11 Pro Max you get the idea it  is Improvement every year but personally I don't  think it's worth upgrading from a 13 Pro Max to a  14 pro Max but if you do have an older iPhone yeah  maybe it is worth upgrading you are going to see  some changes and there's definitely some worthy  upgrades in there what are your thoughts on this  I'd love to know and put them down in the comments  Below guys and on that note it's also time to wrap  up this video so pressing down the iPhone 13 Pro  max if you have enjoyed watching it please do  press the like button and also at the same time as  well guys please also make sure you subscribe to  the channel and hit that notification Bell because  it's gonna be more videos coming along for the  iPhone 14 pro Max very very soon and with that  guys it's time to go take care now then bye bye
GoLxZqzOTAY,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"[CINEMATIC INTRO]Andrew here - hope you're well! With each  generational iPhone release and well over  1 billion iPhone owners globally, we're coming to  expect more than just a camera bump from Apple and  the iPhone 14 Pro is one of the more Innovative  iterations in recent years but is the iPhone 14  Pro the right choice I didn't want to rush this  review out because I wanted to distance myself  away from all the hype surrounding the phone  and there's a lot of hype so here is my honest  review on the new iPhone 14 Pro after spending  over 200 hours with it since launch and I want  to share my five or ten cents here on the dynamic  Island the display the performance because there  are some issues here that I feel aren't talked  about enough and I'll also be comparing the 14  to the 12 and 13 Pro so as usual let's start with  the negatives you should carefully consider before  you buy the first negative has to be the battery  life for me personally anyway if you're coming  from the iPhone 13 be prepared for a slightly  backward step with the iPhone 14 Pro's battery  on average I'm getting 10 hours of use which is  enough to last me the day but considering that  the iPhone 13 Pro managed to juice out 12 hours  of use on average that's almost a 20 decrease  that's a significant backwards step it's kind of  odd considering there's a battery size bump of  105 milliamps up to now 3 200 milliamps in the  14 pro totally different story with the 14 pro  Max by the way which now has a smaller battery in  comparison to its brother and previous generation  the shorter battery life is likely a combination  of iOS 16 and the always on display which is quite  interesting and I'll dive into later in this  review for most people who charge their phones  at Night 10 hours of use is enough if you're a  power user or an avid traveler for example Apple  you probably don't want to leave the charger  or power bank at home just yet also despite a  number of rumors USBC is nowhere to be seen on the  iPhone 14 which may bother some were stuck with a  lightning port for another year but it's likely  at this point the iPhone 15 will launch with a  USB C Port considering the EU has voted in favor  of forcing Consumer Electronic manufacturers like  apple to adopt USBC in all mobile devices in case  you're wondering what the fuss is with USBC in  the first place well the biggest reason for USBC  is the fact that it's a standardized cable that  most people now have access to at home and it can  power devices at up to 100 Watts with fast data  transfer rates speaking of charging speeds we're  still maxed out at 20 watts wired charging with  the iPhone 14 which is a tough pill to swallow  considering many Android phones are equipped with  at least 45 Watts fast charging like the Samsung  s22 heck even the OnePlus 10t even goes up to an  insane 150 watts wire charging which gives you a  full day's charge within 10 minutes but no doubt  Apple has their reasons for keeping the charging  speed modest a big factor being battery health  the lower wattage charging favors battery Health  and Longevity over insanely fast charging which  is arguably more important for your everyday user  anyway the next negative and this will come down  to Personal Taste is the iPhone's aging design  it features the same squared flat Edge design  seen in the previous two generations and it is  aesthetically almost identical with the iPhone  13 here minus the colors of course I guess don't  fix what's not broken right for iPhone 14s bought  in the US though you'll be missing the physical  Sim slot which is currently an inconvenience for  most especially if you're traveling to third world  countries where they heavily rely on the SIM card  slot still The prominent visual design changes  are seen in the colors the giant camera lenses  and replacement of the notch with a pill shape  cut out and this is where things get much more  interesting I've got here the new space black and  the Deep Purple colors both absolutely beautiful  in their own right the Deep Purple is similar to  the new Macbook airs midnight color in that it's  not exactly purple rather a more darkish gray with  a slight purple Hue that comes alive in certain  lighting and angles it's absolutely stunning  in daylight the safe black is more of a space  gray and graphite than it is a straight black but  the railings and the camera cutout is definitely  a nice deep glossy black I'm still wishing a jet  black or matte black iPhone is released to satisfy  my minimalistic Cravings that'd be pretty nice  let me know in the comments which color you think  is best by the way it's worth mentioning all  iPhones are fitted with Apple's ceramic Shield  included ever since the iPhone 12 and if my iPhone  12 is anything to go by it's going to stay scratch  free with a little care despite even a few drops  meanwhile sapphire crystal protects the camera  lenses and this is a great time to take a look  at the absolutely stunning triple cameras here  on the iPhone 14 Pros there's a lot of goodies to  go through here the camera is one of the largest  changes this year aside from Dynamic Island which  I'll review in a moment we now finally have a  new 48 megapixel camera at F 1.78 aperture new  photonic engine features and a quad buyer color  filter this translates into a powerful upgrade  in the camera sensor where it'll group every four  pixels into a quad pixel to optimize what better  light capture and Standard 12 megapixel photos  when you turn on Pro raw mode though this is where  it gets really really fun you get access to the  48 megapixel sensor for much more detail ideal  for cropping in or for prints the photo shot in  Pro raw blew me away and it offers more realistic  contrast especially in Shadows with less artifacts  and artificial sharpening which is really really  nice the ultra wide camera also features a new  12 megapixel true depth camera with auto focusing  faster F 1.9 aperture for better low-light photos  yes slow light photos is a focus this year they're  so much better even the selfie camera comes with a  brighter F 1.9 23 millimeter lens and supports  autofocus with now Optical image stabilization  something that Apple didn't mention at the event  but the various teardown videos have revealed  later on there is so much to the camera this year  and my inner photography hobbyist is super excited  to shoot Pro Raw on my trips abroad so subscribe  and stay tuned for a full review on the camera  itself where I'll take it for a full spin on an  iPhone only photography and videography day before  we move on one other design flaw with the camera I  just have to point out it sort of irks me to this  day it's the insanely large camera bump coming  from an iPhone 12 Pro where it sits nice and  flush on tables the 14 pro sits at an angle like  a ramp and jiggles around as you can see here am I  the only one who's urged by this to get up to sit  flush it will have to set camera facing up which  defeats the purpose of the always on display  and the new always on display may be a hit and  miss for some but I've personally looked down at  it multiple times thinking to myself why is the  display still on didn't I just lock my phone it's  really that bright as much as it's technically  impressive I'm not sure yet if I'm the biggest fan  and I'll likely turn off the always-on display not  only does it eat our battery life from what I've  seen so far it's just a big distraction having my  phone screen win notifications on staring at me  in the face while I'm working or socializing I  mean I already have the Apple watch in that role  you could also argue the point of and always on  display is to have most of the screen turned off  so it doesn't need our battery life that said it's  a nice feature to have but what's more arguably  impressive is the display itself the highest peak  brightness of any smartphone with the increased  brightness improving overall color rendering too  with over 2000 nits of potential brightness  this means we can now use our iPhones under  direct sunlight even with a ton of glare and with  sunglasses on pair this with this silky smooth  adaptive promotion refresh rate of up to 120  hertz and you've got a winner of a display the  very noticeable difference on this display though  is of course Dynamic Island it's a great idea on  paper but with personal use every day since launch  over the last 200 hours or so I'm hesitant to say  it's the best change ever it has potential but  it's yet to realize in in Apple's keynote it's  a feature that looks quite well Dynamic but  from my personal use as an everyday user I  don't interact with Dynamic Island all that often  if at all and that's because I've seen a little  third-party support for it with the apps that I  use currently when I do see it in use with face  ID incoming phone calls and with Spotify they're  purely cosmetic then genuinely useful Integrations  it also interferes with my beloved shortcut of  tapping the top of the iPhone to instant scroll to  the top of an app or web page I genuinely do hope  that the usefulness of dynamic Island will change  in future and it should when the live activities  API rolls out later this year for developers to  make use of but for now if you're upgrading with  the expectation that you know dynamic Island will  change your life it won't not just yet anyway  moving on to the performance the iPhone 14 Pros  are the only Apple product to feature the new  a16 bionic chip at the moment Apple claims it's  40 faster than the competition but comparing it  to the already powerful a15 chip shows a more  interesting story running a geekbench 5 test here  the iPhone 14 pro scored 1873 for this single core  test compared to the iPhone 13 Pro that's about  10 faster single and multi-core processing which  is substantial enough but nothing too ground  breaking so in daily use the phone's still  as Snappy as ever as we've come to expect from an  iPhone and it's no different here the a16 chip is  a winner in my eyes when it comes to sound though  I haven't seen many talk about the speakers on the  iPhone 14 pro but it's great thanks to the hybrid  stereo speakers the phone now syncs the left and  right orientation when held in landscape mode so  I'll switch the audio channels to match the way  you're holding it this means a great surround  sound experience no matter the way you hold it  the audio is superbly balanced and the sound is  Rich and deep and also loud enough to leave in  your bathroom while you shower let's be real guys  before being there okay so is it all worth it and  who is it for well all of these premium features  will set you back 999 US Dollars and runs up to  1499 dollars for the one terabyte version this is  the same pricing as the previous generation which  is a win in this inflation world but by no means  is it considered cheap especially when they're  almost on par with MacBook Air pricing if you ask  me though it's a fair price to pay for one of the  best phones if not the best phone in the market  right now yes as a package it is rough around the  edges more so than the hype reviews lead us to  believe it's left me wanting more particularly  with Dynamic Island and its aging design all in  all it's an evolutionary phone not a revolutionary  one and here is my recommendation if you're tight  on money or if you really want USBC prioritized  battery life and charging speeds then you may want  to look elsewhere outside of Apple if you're big  on battery life take a look at the 13 Pro Max  which Still Remains the Undisputed Battery King  but on the other hand if you want the latest and  greatest love mobile photography or just in need  of an upgrade like I was from the 12 Pro this  is the time to upgrade and the right choice for  you with the 14 Pro's incredible camera insane  display and top performance if you made it to  the end Drop The Code by comment triple camera  and I'll give it a like and while you're here  I'll share a video where I go over the 14 must  change settings when you get the new iPhone 14  or update to iOS 16. there is a lot of changes  and settings that you should set up when you  update and migrate over to get the most out  of your new phone so I'll leave it right here  for you to check out and as always guys thanks  for watching and I'll see you in the next video"
6hk0Kr2kt8o,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"(upbeat music)- What's up guys?Saf here on SuperSaf TV,and we've got them in the house,the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.If you're interested in the regular iPhone 14,I've covered that in a separate video,which has also gone live.I'll link that video down in the description.Now these have some big, big updates,so let's go ahead and get these unboxed,and see what they have to offer.So the unboxing experience is identical for both devices.We do have a pictureof the front of the smartphones on the box,and inside we are immediately presentedwith the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max,which we'll put to the side for just a second.There's also a little pack with a SIM card tool,some paperwork, and an Apple sticker,and finally, a USB-type-C-to-lightning cable.Now, no surprises herethat there is no charger included out of the box.You will have to use one that you already have,or get one separately.And let's go ahead and remove the paper screen protectors,not plastic.And here we are guys, the new iPhone 14 Pros.So we've got the space black color here for the Pro,and for the Pro Max we've got this deep purple.These are the new colors.We've also got like a silver and gold.Now this deep black is darker compared to the space gray,and I really do like it,especially the stainless steel frame.It's full-on black with this matte finish on the back,which you also have on this deep purple,which I think is going to be the most popular.Now, generally, in terms of the designfrom the back, anyway,these are quite similar to the iPhone 13 Pros.We've got the camera rings,although the camera module is now larger.Matte glass on the back,glossy stainless steel frames,IP68 water and dust-resistant rating.However, when we go to the front,this is where we have the big updates.So we still have ceramic shield,but you'll notice that instead of the notchthat we've had for quite a few years now,since the iPhone X,we now have this pill-shaped cutout,which Apple is calling the Dynamic Island.So this is basically a cutout for the front-facing camera,and all of the sensors.Now we've seen some punch-out cameras beforeon many other devices for the front-facing camera,and we've also seen some pill-shaped cutoutson other devices,but those have generally been on the left or the right.We've not seen a pill-shaped cutout bang in the center.And Apple is fully owning this punch-outby calling it the Dynamic Island.You'll also noticethat we have a lighter wallpaperto really make it stand out.Now, if you do bring the iPhone 13 Pro Max for a comparison,you'll notice that Apple is using much darker wallpapersto almost hide that notch and make it fade away.And if you put a lighter wallpaper on the 13 Pro Max,you'll really see the differencebetween the notch and the Dynamic Island.We've also got slightly smaller borders on the 14 Pro Maxin comparison to last year,although you'll probably only notice thisif you do look at them side by side.Right, now let's talk a little bit aboutthis Dynamic Island.So Apple has added lots of software featuresto utilize that area rather than what others have done,and just had that as a simple cutoutfor the front-facing camera.So the Dynamic Island is going to display notifications,and it's also compatible with lots of different apps.So if you get a notification,maybe you're receiving something via AirDrop,then the Dynamic Island is going to dynamically expand,and show you this information.If you're listening to music, for example,you can just swipe up,and then you'll have an animation displayingon the Dynamic Island.You can tap the Dynamic Islandto switch back into your music app.You can Force Touch the Dynamic Islandto have a preview popup where you can control your music,and while that's happening,you can open up a stopwatch, for instance,and then also swipe up,and then that's going to appear as a separate bubble,which you can also Force Touch and expand.Right, now, what are my thoughts about the Dynamic Island?Well, I really like the factthat Apple has owned that punch-out,and really made it their own,with all of the animations and the software.In terms of usability, and the day to day,I do like it for the preview.I'm going to have to see how it isto reach over all the way at the top,because when I'm holding my phone,then I am going to have to use my other handto reach all the way to the Dynamic Islandif I do want to interact with it.And also my other concern is the factthat we do have the front-facing camerawithin the Dynamic Island,and while I'm touching the Dynamic Island,no doubt, I am going to be touching the front-facing camera,and putting fingerprints on it,so I will have to wipe it down a lot morejust to make sure that selfies are clear.Right, so that's the Dynamic Island,but the display improvements don't stop there.We now have a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits outdoors,which makes these the brightest displayson any smartphone right now.And as well as that, we do have ProMotion technology,which means that we have up to 120Hz,making everything very, very smooth.The iPhone 14 Pros have LTPO displays,with an adaptive refresh rate,and they can go all the way down to just 1Hz.Now that means a couple of things.Firstly, when you do have static content like this,the displays are not going to have to use too much powerto refresh 60 times,but as well as that,for the first time we have Always-On displays on iPhones.This is something that I've been asking for forever,so I'm so, so happy that we now have Always-On displays.And as we have with the punch-out for the Dynamic Island,Apple has really made the Always-On displaytheir own as well.We've seen Always-On displays for years on other devices,so Apple is definitely playing catch up,but I do like the way they've implementedthe Always-On display on the iPhone 14 Pros.So if you're listening to some music,the Always-On display is still going to displaythe album art.You can also add widgets to the Always-On display,and customize these.Now, not many Always-On displays out thereallow you that much ability to customize,but on top of that,if you do have a colored wallpaper on your lock screen,this is still going to be displayedon the Always-On in color, just dimmed out.Now, I think that's really cool,especially the addition of widgetsfor your Always-On display,and being able to customize that.Now let's move onto the cameras,and I'm super excited about the iPhone 14 Pro cameras,because we've got some big, big improvements,starting with the front-facing TrueDepth camera.This is now 12MP,we've got a wider aperture,and we have autofocus for the first timefrom a front-facing camera on an iPhone.This is going to mean that you'll be able to take selfiesright up close, or from a distance as well,and unlike previous iPhones, where the focus is fixed,you're going to get much sharper results,and the wider aperture and the new sensor will also meanthat you're going to get better low-light selfies.So those are the front-facing cameras,but we've also got some significant improvementsfor the rear-facing cameras.So the primary camera is now 48MP,and it's a 65% larger-sized sensor compared to the 13 Pros.Now we haven't seen a resolution increase on iPhone camerasfor many, many years,so it's nice to see this very large-sized sensorwith the high resolution.Now, generally, you still will be shooting at 12MP,and that's because the camera uses quad-pixel technology,which is basically pixel-binning.It's going to combine four pixels into oneto give you improved low light.However, if you do want to shoot at the full 48MP,you can do that with Apple ProRAW,which is going to give you some very, very detailed images.And we also have a brand-new sensorfor the Ultra Wide camera,which is almost twice the size as what we've had previously.This still does have autofocus,which means that you're going to be ableto focus right up close,and get amazing macro shots.And then we've got the Telephoto camera,which is going to give you 3x optical zoom.Now, as far as I can see, in terms of the hardware,this hasn't changed much.However, you can get 2x optical zoom as well.And that's thanks to the new primary sensor.What it's essentially going to dois it's going to crop in to the main sensor,get the middle part of it,and give you the equivalent of 2x optical zoom.And you'll also be able to take portraits nowat 2x as well as 3x.Portrait mode has also had an improvement,and you're going to be able to get foreground blur,as well as background blur,so this should give you much more realistic portraits.And Apple is now usingwhat they're calling a Photonic Engine,which is going to process images in the raw stageto give you much better results,especially in low light.So you've got a 2x low-light improvementfor the primary camera,as well as the telephoto, and the selfie camera,and you've got up to a 3x low-light improvementfor the UltraWide camera.- Um, do you want to remind them of the camera?- I'll do it.- Okay- - I'll do it.- Okay, fair enough.- Guys, as SideSaf has said,I am working on a SuperSafStyle camera comparisonof the iPhone 14 Pro Max versus the competition.If you want to see that first, you know what to do guys,make sure you subscribe,and hit that bell icon so you don't miss it.We now also have a 2x bighter flash.I generally don't use flash when taking images,but I'm of course going to be testing this out.We've also got big improvements for video,4K, 60 fps, HDR with Dolby Vision,which we were expecting,but now we have 4K up to 30 fps for cinematic video.Cinematic video is whereit's going to artificially blur the backgroundto give you more of a cinema look.I was pessimistic about this initially,I'll be honest with you,but I have actually been using it more and moreon my iPhone 13 Pro Max,and I can only expect to use it even moreon the iPhone 14 Pro Max now that it supports 4K.And Apple now also has a new action mode,which is going to stabilize your footage,especially very shaky footage,if you're running or something like that.Now this is going to be down to 2.8K, not 4K,but it looks very impressive,and I cannot wait to test this out.Right, now what's powering the iPhone 14 Pros?Well, we do have the brand-new A16 Bionic chip,which has been improved in terms of performance,compared to the A14,and we have a big improvementin terms of efficiency as well.Now my iPhone 13 Pro Maxstill handles whatever I throw at it,so I'm confident that the iPhone 14 Proswill still be at the top of the game.And with the efficiency improvementswe should still be getting great battery life,despite having things like the Always-On display,which will of course demand more battery.For charging, these do support 20W of wired charging,with a charger that you'll have to get separately,but with that, you can get up to 50% in around 30 minutes,and we of course do have supports for MagSafe,so you can get up to 15W of charging using MagSafe,and around 7.5W of chargingusing a regular Qi wireless charger.And in terms of other features,we do have stereo speakers, of course,.We've got one speaker in the earpiece,and one bottom-firing.Face ID is still here,and all of the sensors are here within the Dynamic Island,and you may have noticed from the Apple keynotethat certain areas will not be having a SIM card tray.Here in the UK, we still do get a SIM card tray,but in the US, it is going to be eSIM only.Now Apple has also added some new sensorsto the iPhone 14 Pros.So we do have crash detection now.If you are involved in a crash,then the iPhones will be able to notice this,and they'll be able to contact emergency servicesif you do not respond.A very useful feature,which I'm hoping that I'll never have to test.And we also have Emergency SOS via Satellite.This is where, if you don't have any reception or network,you'll still be able to contact emergency servicesusing satellite technology.Now this is coming in November to the US and Canada.I'm not sure when it's going to be coming to the UK,and it's going to be included for two yearswith the purchase of a new iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max.And I'm assuming after thatthere will be some form of subscription model.Now finally, storage and pricing.These are available in a 128, 256, 512GB,or a 1TB option as well, if you really want that storage.And the good news is,for the Americans that are watching this,you will be paying the same starting priceas you did for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.So that's $1,000 for the iPhone 14 Pro,and $1100 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max.However, in the UK,there has been a price increase, unfortunately.The iPhone 14 Pro will be starting at 1100 pounds,and the iPhone 14 Pro Max will be starting at 1200 pounds.If you do want to go for the 1TB option,that goes all the way up to 1750 pounds.Now, I'm not sure why this is.I'm assuming with the whole Brexit,and inflation situation here in the UK,Apple has to increase prices,but that is the iPhone 14 Pro,as well as the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Personally speaking,I'm super excited to try these out,especially with all of the new changes,with the Dynamic Island and all of the camera improvements.What do you guys think?Which one of these will you be picking up, if you will be?Do drop me a comment below and let me know.Let me know what other coverage you'd like me to dowith the iPhone 14 Pros,because trust me, there's going to be a lot coming up on here.If you don't want to miss any of that,then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon,and that way you'll be notifiedas soon as that content is live.If you're interested in the regular iPhone 14,I have covered that in a separate video,which you can check out here in the card.There will also be a related video here.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did, then do smash that like button for me.Thanks for watching, this is Saf on SuperSaf TV,and I'll see you next time."
PG52hr3jyZE,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,14 pro vs 14 pro Max you just choose thesize that you like right wrong today Iwill talk about all of the differencesthat I found in the last two weeks usingthese phones and which one I have to gowith this time around now the first mostobvious one is the comfort in the handsI love the way the 14 pro feels the sizeis just right even though I have largehands the 14 pro still feels large andthen you have the whole fact ofreachability whereas with the 14 pro Ican reach most things on the screen andthe 14 pro Max things start to get alittle bit more difficult especially ifI'm trying to reach for things likeadjusting my brightness hitting next onsomething trying to turn off myBluetooth or other settings now ofcourse we do have reachability so youcan swipe down and that helps out but ingeneral just pulling out my thumb tryingto hit stuff this is definitely atwo-handed device in general the 14 projust feels more solid you have a bettergrip on it and it feels nicer in thehand which is why last year I went withthe 13 Pro over the 13 Pro Max now theyear before that I did go with the 12Pro Max and that is because it had abetter camera system and photos are veryimportant to me so I had to go with thatone but this year I found a lot moredifferences in real world Usage Now thenext one some of you guys might expectbut the one after that I don't think youwill now for this one we have to talkabout the speakers the iPhone 14 pro Maxshocked us when we heard how amazing thespeakers were they were better in everyway compared to the 13 Pro Max butgetting to use the 14 pro I was slightlydisappointed and then I tested out sideby side well let's go ahead and take alistensomeone around[Music][Applause][Music]the 14 pro Max is noticeably louder nowthe sound quality is fairly similar Iwould almost have to say that the 14 promight sound slightly better but it onlyhas about 90 percent of the volume asthe larger size and if you turn thisdown by a little bit well then the soundquality is identical and I love havingthat extra Headroom and in the past whenhe tested this both phones sounded thesame so that is a difference this yearwith that if you're watching YouTubevideos or movies the 410 Pro also has alarger screen but one thing I didn'texpect is the fact that a lot of ultrawide videos are now in a letter box onall four sides because Apple doesn'twant to cut into the island so the videois smaller than previous years thatmakes the 14 pro Max much moreadvantageous and with that if you'rewatching videos perfectly formatted forthe iPhone 13 and 12 series well on the14 pro it does cut into the DynamicIsland here and it cuts into the islandmore so on the 14 pro compared to the 14pro Max not a huge difference but it'sthere because they do have a differentaspect ratio now the next thing I wantto talk about is cellular reception andspeed but before that whether or notyou're going to be upgrading to one ofthese iPhone 14 Pros you're going towant to keep your personal dataprotected by using the premium SecuritySuite from our sponsor Trend Micro whichoffers complete protection for up to 10of your devices including any iOS deviceyou have as well as Android's MaxWindows laptops and even Chromebooks andwhen I say complete I mean it because itincludes all of the security productsincluding Maximus security whichprotects against identity theft dark weband data breaches malware virusesransomware phishing scams and otherthreats as well as offering secureonline banking and shopping which ofcourse covers your mobile devices aswell you also get the built-in passwordmanager across all of your devices thatgenerates passwords and it comes withkeystroke encryption to protect from Keylogging malware even better it all comeswith their VPN proxy 1 Pro to protectyour web usage as well as turning publichotspots into secure Wi-Fi connectionswhich is probably the biggest deal outof the entire suite and finally you get24 7 technical support and emergencyassistance included so check it outusing the link in the description belowand now let me tell you what I found asfar as cellular speeds and connectivityyou would expect that both phones wouldbe the same but they're not inside thisconcrete building connected to 5G midband you see that the 14 pro Max gets amuch faster download speed and upload isthe same and both these phones aretested one by one connected same networksame server held the same now switchingover to LTE both had the same bar shownup and the performance was practicallyidentical now heading outside so we'renot in a concrete building the LTEspeeds once again were very similarslightly faster on the 14 pro Max andswitching over to our 5G the downloadspeeds were slightly slower on the 14pro but the upload was close to half thespeed and you guys can see that itactually had one bar less reception Iknow some people say hey those speedsare slow I get way faster with my olderphone it all varies depending on yournetwork where you are congestion that'swhy I test these in identical situationssame of a provider same server and itjust shows you the difference incellular reception based on the powerusage it has what Apple's allowing it todo so if you want the best cellularspeeds you need the 14 pro Max now thenext thing I want to talk about isdisplay brightness now both of thesehave 2 000 nit capable displays they'rebeautiful outside combat that brightlight you can see it very easily andthat's amazing but with that I noticedanother difference and that comes downto screen dimming now I did see my 14pro Max dim outside in the hot sun afterit was running at that Peak brightnessand it wasn't a huge deal it dimmed justa little bit brighter than the 13 ProMax series but with the 14 pro itactually dims faster and more so and Isaw the same thing while playing gamesand testing out some gaming benchmarksthat's just because the chassis issmaller it can't dissipate that heat aswell it can't spread it out as well andas far away so it does end up dimmingfaster so if you're somebody that hatesthat well the 14 pro Max definitelyhelps now the same thing goes as Imentioned with gaming since you have alarger chassis well you're going to gethigher FPS for a longer amount of timeand less dimming as well because ofthermal performance and I ran ourthermal camera you guys could see howthe 14 pro is hotter and it's moreconcentrated heat as well now with thatif you love gaming well the experienceon the 14 pro Max is much better youhave a much larger device your thumbscover up less of the screen you see yourenemies if you're playing like an FPSshooter that I love easier overall it'sa much nicer experience and with thatyou have a larger battery and that leadsme into the battery life section now atthis point I know that some battery lifeissues have to be because of iOS anddifferent bugs but in general last yearI was able to use a 13 Pro because thebattery life had such a step up from the12 Pro which I couldn't use a smallerdevice that it lasted me a full day butthis year this device the 14 pro doesnot now I know there's a lot of testsonline comparing battery life forexample Mr who's the boss he got abouttwo hours extra screen on time and realworld usage with the 14 pro Max and thatwas always similarly the case but whatthose tests don't show you is thedifference when you have the autobrightness turned on when you're hittingthat 2000 they don't show you backgroundapp usage with different apps pullingyour data while your screen is offusually they're not testing out thespeakers being played either they don'tshow you the always-on display beingused for example Phone Arena did a greatvideo and they compared it to the lastyear series but they didn't test all ofthat so the battery that didn't seemthat much worse or in fact it actuallydid better in some cases but in the realworld my 14 pro Max performs similarlyor even slightly worse than my old 13Pro with all the same usage Styles butof course now we have always on displaythe crazy bright display and I lovethose features so this year the 14 proit will not last me a full day I have tocharge up around six o'clock whereaswith the 14 pro Max some days will lastme all day some days it doesn't so I amliterally forced to go with the 14 proMax yes even though I don't want to eventhough I love the size of the 14 pro thefeel I would be okay with not havingthat as loud as of the speakersI would be okay with some of thereception issues because I love the sizeI cannot do it and when you add allthose other things in the loudestspeakers the display staying brighterthe larger screen for watching videosand the speakers even though the camerasare identical which matter a lot to me Ihave to go with the 14 pro Max and everytime I pick up the 14 pro and put in myhands I'm I just think man I should justdeal with the smaller phone because Ilike it so much but I cannot so thereyou guys go

Jls7QzOjWmk,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"- The iPhone 14s are finally official.I've had some early hands-on time,and here's everything you need to know.What's up, guys?Saf here on SuperSaf TV,and I'm here at Apple Park.Now, we've got four new iPhones as expected.There is no longer a Mini.RIP to the Mini.So we have the iPhone 14,the iPhone 14 Plus,the iPhone 14 Pro,as well as the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Now, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus,incremental updates overall.We've got a similar design.We've still got the notch.We do have brighter displays.We've got some improvements for the cameras as well,but we have the A15 Bionic chip.It's the A15 that was in the Pro models last year.However, the ones you really want to know aboutare the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.So, starting off with the design,they do look familiar.We do have a couple of new colors.We've got the Space Black,which is really black,and does attracts some fingerprints,but then we've also got a Deep Purple,which is a new colorand is going to be the flagship color.But the big change is actually at the frontbecause we now have a pill-shaped cutout instead of a notchand Apple called this the Dynamic Island,a very Apple name to give it.Now we've seen pill-shaped cutouts before on other devicesusually on the left or the right.I don't believe we've seen one in the middle,and also, Apple is implementing it slightly differentlybecause they're actually using thisas an interactive element.So if you're listening to music,you can minimize itand you'll still be able to see some animations there.You can force touch to expandand then control things.You can also have multiple apps open.You can have two,so you can have, say, the stopwatchwhich is going to be a little dot,which you can again force touchand get more information from.And it just is very, very smooth the way it worksand it is a different implementation.It's going to be interesting to see how that worksbecause you're constantly going to be touchingthat where the front-facing camera is.So you might be getting some fingerprints on there.So I assume you'll be rubbing that off quite a bitwhile you're shooting.But we have further improvements for the display as well.We've got slimmer bordersand we've got improvements in terms of the brightness,so 1600 nits of peak brightness,but outdoors, it can go all the way up to 2000 nits,making these the brightest displays on any smartphone.I'm very happy about that.As you guys know, I'm always wearing sunglasses.But in addition to that,we've also got improved LTPO technology.And that means you're going to be able to go up to 120 hertzfor the ProMotionbut you can go all the way down to just one hertz.And that enables something that I've been asking forfor years,and that's the always-on display.So the iPhone 14 Pro and the Pro Maxnow have an always-on display.This is quite interesting.You can actually customize some of the widgetsthat you have on there as well, which is really good.And you'll also still have your wallpaper visibleand things like that.That's something that I've not seenon many other always-on displays.Usually, it's kind of like a cutdown version.This, you'll be able to see your full wallpaper,whatever it is.It's obviously just going to be dimmer.So this is something I'm definitely very happy about.Now for the performance,you do have the A16 Bionic chip, which is of course faster,but it's definitely more efficientcompared to what we had last year.So I expect it to be really, really good.We've been using the iPhone 13 Proand the Pro Max for a yearand they've still got excellent performance for the A15,so the A16 can only be better.But there are some new featuresthat Apple has now implemented on the new iPhones.Firstly, we've got Emergency SOS via satellites.So the new iPhones will be able to connect to satellites.If you're all, say, in the middle of nowhereand you do need that emergency contact.Now this is going to be free for a couple of years,and then I believe you're going to have to have some sortof subscription model.And we also have crash detection.This is something that we've got on the Apple watch,but with the new sensors, if you do get into a crash,then it'll be ableto automatically connect emergency services.And the eSIMs.Well, now you'll be able to have multiple eSIMs.And in the U.S. anyway,there is no longer going to be a physical SIM card tray.It's still going to be in other regions,but, yeah, they've got on and rid of thisand now you're just going to have to rely completely on eSIMs,at least in the U.S.Right, now let's talk about the camera.So we mentioned that the front-facing camerain that pill-shaped cutout.This has been improved.So this now has a wide aperture.It's going to be better in low lightbut it also has auto-focus.This is the first time a front-facing camera in an iPhonehas had auto-focus.But the biggest improvements are on the rear-facing camera.So we still have an ultra wide, a primary,as well as a three times telephoto optical zoom camera.And the primary camera has been improved quite a bit.It has a 65% larger sensor size and it's 48 megapixels.This is the first time in quite a few yearsthat Apple has increased the resolutionfor the primary cameraand it uses quad layer technology.So it's basically going to combine four pixelsinto one pixel binning, which we've seen before,and that's going to improve low-light images.However, you can still shoot at 48 megapixels ProResif you do want all of that detail.The ultra wide camera has also been improved.It's now got an F/1.9 aperture,so it's a wider aperture.Again, it's going to be able to capture more light.And Apple now has implemented somethingthat they're calling Photonic Engine.Now this is going to process in the background.So obviously, Apple's all about software and hardwareand this is going to give you improvements in low lightacross all of the cameras.So telephoto camera is still three times,and as far as I can tell hardware-wise,it hasn't been changed.However, the primary camera,now that it has more resolution,you'll be able to now get two times zoom,and this is pretty much just going to crop into the primary sensorand you'll be able to also do portraits at two times.We also have improvements for video.So now we can do 4K in Cinematic mode.Previously, we could only do 1080p in Cinematic mode.And that we've got a new feature called Action mode.So this is going to be a gimbal-like stabilizationfor high action shots.I had a look at this,it can do up to 2.7Kso you're not going to be able to go all the way up to 4K,but hey, it looks pretty promising.And guys, of course,I'm going to be doing some SuperSaf style camera comparisonsof the iPhone 14 Pro Max as soon as I can.If you don't want to miss those,then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon.Now for the battery life, as far as we can tell,the battery life is going to be similarto what we had on the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max,which is really good.Although, the iPhone 14 Plus will have the best battery lifeacross the board.And finally for pricing,now this is quite interesting.If you're in the U.S.,the good news is that pricing will startat the same price that the iPhone 13 Proand Pro Max started at.So that's going to be around $1,000 for the iPhone 14 Proand around $1,100 for the Pro Max.However, if you're in the UK,the starting price has increased.So £1,100 for the iPhone 14 Proand for the Pro Max, starting prices at £1,200.And if you do want to go all the way up to the 1TB versionthen that's around £1,750.So that is quite a bit.So that is the iPhone 14 Pro and the Pro Max.I'm really excited to check them out.What do you guys think of them?Do drop me a comment below.Let me know.As mentioned guys,there's going to be lots more iPhone content coming up here.If you haven't already,then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon.Hope you enjoy this video and find it useful.If you did, then do smash the like button for me.Thanks for watching.This is Saf in SuperSaf TV,and I'll see you next time."
o35DUtGmtW8,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,now if you are coming from the 13 pro max  and you're thinking about picking up the  14 pro max well this video is to hopefully  enlighten you a little bit to the actual real  upgrades we're getting with this model because  i don't think it's worth it we're hardly getting  anything so to start out i'll go over what i think  is the best upgrade we do get with the 14 pro  max model and the other models too the pro  model because the screen is now brighter  now i had an issue with my 13 pro that  when i'd use it out in the heat of summer  and even sometimes in winter you're using it a  lot you're recording footage say 4k footage or  video or you're just using the screen it would  dim down on me to the point as you can see here  where you basically cannot use the phone  i've got to stop using it let it cool down  the great news is we are finally getting past that  problem of the overheating and the dimming screen  the 14 pro screen can pump out a really high 2  000 nets and in use in daytime you can see in  the sun you can see it and it will maintain it for  a very very long time it's only when you start to  record a lot of video use the action mode or 4k  cinematic will eventually start to overheat and  dim down but even as i was recording that shot  there it was getting incredibly hot but it was  pumping out that brightness so that's good so  the display is an upgrade then we get always on  display now always on display is something they  could actually implement and put it of course  here on the 14 pro sorry the 13 pro max and  the 13 pro because they're using oled screen so  it's a software thing really but apple's idea the  implementation of an always-on display to my eyes  is wrong so what they do is they illuminate the  whole screen is on it's basically just a very  dim screen which is still too bright at night and  it uses a lot of energy because of this now other  manufacturers will just put the time the date and  your notifications it'll move around the screen  slowly and it consumes hardly any energy the  impact on your battery is not so bad but with the  14 pro the 14 pro max having that always on  display has absolutely butchered slaughtered  my battery life here and it's so far using of  course going to be worse i have to disable it  so then get about the same battery life as the  13 pro max so in that area it's not really an  upgrade then the dynamic island now you either  love this or you hate it i'm i haven't formed  an opinion yet of it really i don't like it what  i don't like is it's taking up more screen real  estate at the top the animations are nice yes sure  it looks so pretty which i think most people will  go for but the problem is you're going to have  to use it two-handed you can't use it one-handed  with a dynamic island so you're going to have to  have your other hand to support it there at the  top when you use it which is slightly annoying  the other is now they've changed the way the  notifications are with iso 16 and they're a  little bit more troublesome to actually get  to and see they made that a little bit more  difficult so let's talk about the cameras a  lot of people are really into social media  great cameras must have the best cameras now  this is where i think most people are going to  be very disappointed to me it's like apple went  along and just software wise over processed  a little bit they tweaked up the exposure  they over sharpened they introduced more noise  because i've done a bit of a comparison so here  we have a portrait shot from the 13 pro max  it looks really nice and then here is the same  more or less scenario my daughter moves around  a lot she's four years old but it just looks  like apple went and just increased the exposure  they sharpened it up a little bit and look at the  the results i think it's actually worse so so  far in my experience the photos are looking worse  than the 14 pro max and i've even done a bit of  a low light control test here again look at the  noise introduced with the 14 pro max versus the 13  pro max i don't think this is better i think we're  kind of going backwards and i know it's a new  phone and i know with firm firmware updates apple  is probably likely to correct this and improve  things but is it two times better three times  better apple's marketing the fastest iphone yet  the most pro iphone yet you get the idea a lot of  it most of it's just marketing hype now it still  takes some amazing video quality so 4k video looks  really good and i did a camera comparison against  some other top flagships from android and they  just couldn't match the video quality both selfie  and rear cameras especially look really good very  smooth no jitter no jutter when you pan around and  then the action mode this is new the action mode  i actually really do like so it's using a 2.8 k  top resolution very aggressive electronic image  stabilization of course and compared to these  other flagships dominated it absolutely killed  them so if you don't have an action cam but maybe  for some reason you want to chase behind someone  on a bmx or their skateboard or whatever you can  use the action mode so i do like that that is  okay two upgrades there now i'm pretty sure they  could add the action mode to the 13 pro wouldn't  be a problem it's only software they could add the  always-on display as well software again so really  not that much of an upgrade but we do have some  areas that apple just seems to ignore like the  selfie photos they're either too cool the white  balance or too warm where you have orange skin  i see this a lot of my photos just far too warm  they don't seem to be addressing this issue at all  the other is the lens flare that you get with low  light video and low light photos it's terrible it  basically ruins the footage there is a fix other  brands now for years have been using zeiss optics  they've been using a special coating called  the t-star coating it's it's on the uh vivo x  70 pro plus the xperia phones the new one from  sony and the vivo x the vivo x80 pro plus now  it removes all of that well almost and apple need  to do something about that they need to put that  coating on but they just seem to refuse to do that  so there's a couple of areas they haven't really  improved upon we still don't have a kill all in  the task manager you have to keep going swiping up  and kill all your apps off would be nice just to  press one button small little software things do  remain and then don't get me started on the type  c port because where is it it's in the ipads all  right so why can't they add it to the iphones it's  just ridiculous if you need to transfer pro motion  video a huge amount we've got airdrop but imagine  you need to transfer 100 gigabytes worth they're  very large files when you shoot 4k pro res if we  had usb 3.2 type-c port high-speed data transfer  video out things like that that this supposed best  top m flagship are missing out on basic features  that android has had for years and years like  always on display they've finally got it they just  take their time about everything don't understand  they could make the most amazing phone but just  hold back for marketing purposes for uh revenue  generating speaking of which revenue generating  the difference between these two is minimal and  their physical design they're basically the same  right but apple intentionally moves the camera  module like they did from the 12 pro to the  13 pro you can't use your old case well i did  actually i cut around where the camera module is  then i used my 12 pro case on my 13 pro  but i think apple caught on to this and  they decided to move the power button down  slightly so now the 13 pro cases will not  fit on the 14 pro now it's just a small minor  thing but what bugs me is apple's all about  saving the environment now but look at the amount  of waste they could cut down on if the same case  worked on what is essentially the exact same phone  over three years they'll be saving a lot for the  environment right but of course they won't do that  they want to sell more for revenue exactly why  they don't have the charger in the case it's about  getting people to buy newer charges all right now  if you've already got one okay that is where  it's good there if you've already got one i do  i understand that but there's a lot of decisions  that they make that just puzzle me completely  they could make an absolute top fine but they hold  back in some areas so the purpose of the video and  really what i'm getting at is if you've got a 13  pro max and you're thinking about the 14 pro max  or you've got the 14 pro i'm sorry 13 pro thinking  about upgrading to the 14 honestly i wouldn't the  changes just like i've mentioned now they are so  minimal one hardware major change okay the display  being a lot brighter cameras for now until we see  some more firmware updates i think they're almost  backwards so that's not really an upgrade you've  got the action mode the 4k cinematic mode that  you can see now from the sample still doesn't look  perfect but if you need 4k cinematic okay that's  one area but those are software things apple could  add but really it all boils down to the same exact  phone you buy this you're gonna go wow i just  spent all that money for the same exact phone with  basically a brighter screen and a more ugly notch  that's just simple facts so far unless firmware  updates really turn things around thanks a lot for  watching this video i'll see you in the next one
VbXhKS1sZ6Q,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"So I've been using the iPhone 14 Pro Max ever since it was released to the general publicand honestly, I like it so far.I'll make a dedicated review video after a thorough use to show what I like and dislikeabout the phone.But just because everything is fine with my phone doesn't mean it's the same with everyoneelse's.Users of the iPhone 14 Pro lineup around the world are experiencing several bugs and issueswith the handset.The one that had a lot of the users worried is the camera.You see the main camera of the iPhone 14 Pro and Max vibrates and rattles uncontrollablywhen the camera is opened in apps such as Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram, resultingin the shaky video.Now, this happens only while using third-party apps rather than Apple's own Camera app.Now no one knows for sure the underlying cause of the issue.But It seems these apps aren't playing nicely with the optical image stabilization of thephone thus causing the vibration.Users who were afflicted by the problem are hoping for the best-case scenario, which wasthat the issue was software-related and could be fixed by simply pushing out an update.And that is exactly the case.It is a software issue and doesn't need repair.Apple officially said they would issue a firmware update next week to fix the issue.But to be honest, for a device that starts at $1100 in the US and costs an arm and legin the rest part of the world, this problem shouldn't exist in the first place but heyglad that Apple didn't say you're using the camera app wrong.Next is the always-on display.Some users are reporting that their battery life has gotten significantly worse when thealways-on display is on.And it got better when they turned it off.To be honest, I didn't experience that on my phone.Yes, it does consume battery and it's on par with my S22 Ultra.But nothing too crazy.Contrary to what many Apple users are saying, I like the always-on display on the 14 ProMax compared to the one on the S22 Ultra because of the fact that it's different and showsnotifications much better.To see a speed test between the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra click here and I'llsee you tomorrow...peace out"
px6V2WX0TPM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"(upbeat music)- It is apple season, and I am so excited,because in front of me are all of the new iPhones,all of the new Apple Watches,and, of course, our new AirPods Pro 2.Now, what I'm most excited about, of course, because,well, you know, I do love a good iPhone.We have four of them in front of us.We have the new iPhone 14,the iPhone 14 Plus,the iPhone 14 Pro,and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Now, this is the new purple, absolutely stunning.I'm so excited about it.Like, the thing that I love so much about it isit's one of those things, like,when you look at the color,and as you move it around,it kind of changes in the light.The purple is surprisingly so beautiful,and Tim Cook today had ona beautiful purple shirt to match.The thing that you'll notice, though, in the Pro,and the regular iPhone 14,is they still do have the notch,but the Pros are the onesthat have the upgraded Dynamic Island.And why they call it this is becausewhile it looks like that's just a normal cutout,they've turned this into a feature.So when we open up some music,and we swipe upto play it,you'll notice that it pops up here and it's interactive.So when we start the timer and we close that,that also pops up there in our Dynamic Island,and we can long pressto bring them upand to close.So it's kind of like another little notification hub,which is kind of cool.So here are some of the new colors.This is the space black, we've got the purple,and this is the light kind of purple-ish color,which is very faint, but it's really, really pretty.I do also really like this blue.Mm. They look so nice.The iPhone 14 comes in two sizes,the 6.1 inch and the new 6.7 inch Plus model.It has an XDR 1,200 nits double Ceramic Shield display,12 megapixel front-facing camerawith 49% improved low light,with the same A15 bionic chipthat was in the iPhone 13 Pros.But with new thermal improvements,you're basically getting an upgraded iPhone 13in a 14 body without a telephoto lens,but with all the new crash detectionand emergency satellite communication features.Both the 14s and the 14 Proshave the ability to shoot in action stabilization mode,for super smooth Gimbal-like video.The iPhone 14s will start at 799,with the Plus option starting at 899.This is the Pro Max, and this is the Pro,and this is the new deep purple color.I'm actually really surprised how much I love this color.It's like a perfect complimentto all of the past colorslike the blue and the green.I am still hoping one day they'll make a hot pink.Tim, come on! Let's do it!Anyway, let's take a closer look.The Pro models have a new brighter displayup to 2,000 nits,which is twice as much as before.It features the A16 bionic chip,upgraded larger camera sensorthat shoots 48 megapixel photos.It has a 4k cinematic mode,and all of the same new satelliteand crash detection features as the 14.The Dynamic Island is also only available on the Pros,while the iPhone 14still has the notch-like cutout, as before.You'll also have the ability to shoota new 2X mode, adding to the 0.5, 1, and 3x telephoto.The pros are starting at 999,with up to one terabyte of storage.(upbeat music)I love the new purple color.This is definitely the one that I'm gonna order.Or wait, am I gonna order the gold again?Because the gold, it's just, it's my aesthetic,but also the purple, it's really pretty.This is when I need the Apple Watch Ultra,because I feel like I've just summitedsome sort of mountain, I don't know.Those steps are aggressive.(upbeat music)Thank you guys so much for watching.I have a bunch more videos for you guys to check out.I will put them here in the end card,and also in the description.If you guys haven't already,be sure to subscribeand make sure you hit the bell,so you get notified when I post new videos,and leave me a commentand let me know what your favorite thing isthat Apple has announced so far.I'll see you guys in the next one.Bye!(upbeat music)"
BMo1ZLzHH18,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,we have the first reveal of the iphone 14 pro max  along with exciting news of a surprise  new feature coming to the new iphones!so the iphone 14 series launch event it's finally  official and today we've got plenty to share about  the exciting new release from apple we had  early rumors of satellite connectivity for  the iphone 14s and then it had been assumed that  these rumours were false but Ming Chi Kuo is now  saying it's happening according to ming chi quo  apple has been working with global star to bring  satellite communication to the latest iphone and  that the hardware was ready before mass production  of the iphone 14. he does however advise it that  apple were still negotiating a business model with  the provider and the release of this far out event  could well mean that we do see this new feature  satellite communication would allow for emergency  text and voice messages when there's no cell  signal at all and all in all it's a great feature  while plenty of evidence points to it being  included in the iphone 14 however there is a small  chance that the far out launch event could just be  something like an astrophotography mode now next  up we've got news that the iphone 14 pro models  are going to support 30 watt fast charging thanks  to a new tweet from dwan rui now he tweeted to say  that a charger brand recently began sending out  30 watt charger products to the media for the  new iphone 14 series and that these chargers were  30 watts now to be clear there was an unofficial  testing of the previous 13 pro max and that showed  it peaked at 27 watts fast charge so this isn't a  huge jump anyway we also know that the iphone 14  pro max is still going to be using a lightning  cable instead of usbc and i've read a report in  the past that 2.4 amps is actually the maximum  current through a lightning cable so i wouldn't be  surprised if we see a fast charge pretty much the  same as last year next up we had plenty of news  about the primary camera upgrades to the iphone 14  and now we've got some good news about the ultra  wide reliable analyst ming chi quo was tweeted to  say that the ultrawide is going to be upgrading  it to a 1.4 micrometer sensor compared to the  previous one micrometer now this means 40 larger  pixels which should result in better photography  overall but especially in low light conditions now  he also says that these camera components are more  expensive than the existing ones and that's most  likely part of the reason that we're expecting a  100 price increase on the iphone 14 pro models but  not on the standard models now next up we've got  another tweet from duan rui that are supposedly  images of the real iphone 14. it's reported that  these images are originally from weibo and he's  republished them on twitter and it shows us what  we can expect from the pill shape and the camera  cutouts he gives us multiple images and they do  look very convincing but there's unfortunately  no way to verify them at this moment in time  they do also look very similar to the recent  dummy model that ice universe published on twitter  i've also created this concept unboxing here to  give you guys a good look at what we can expect  next week and for those of you that want to see  more of this type of stuff then just follow me  over on instagram and tick tock using the links  in the description and then you can see them as  they're posted now overall though the iphone 14  is a very exciting release it's the first iphone  in a long time without a notch we get a huge bump  up to a 48 MP primary camera along with a larger  sensor on the ultra wide we've got new features  potentially coming like satellite communication  and of course we get the new a16 bionic because  phone prices are so high though it's probably  not going to warrant an upgrade for most people  already using an iphone 13 but for those on older  iphones or buying their first iphone then the  iphone 14 series is going to be a great choice  now for those excited we're now going to run  through the full specs design and the expected  pricing of each iphone 14 in the range for my  regular viewers you guys have seen this so just  skip to the next video but if you are new here  then hit subscribe now and we'll get right into it  to start with the new entry level model is going  to be the iphone 14 with the iphone 14 we get a  6.1 inch super retina oled display it's expected  to be an 1170 by 2532 resolution and while many  sources claim it's a 90 hertz display there  is a chance that it could still be 60 hertz  on the front we'll be getting a 12 megapixel  selfie camera but unlike the pro models we will  have a notch instead of a punch hole camera on the  rear it's looking like a dual camera setup while  early rumors suggested a lidar scanner that's  unfortunately not going to be the case the dual  camera setup is going to consist of a wide angle  and an ultra wide camera and the phone is going to  be powered up by the a15 bionic that we saw last  year although it will likely be modified slightly  and it may still come under an a16 model name  it's going to be coming with 6 gigabytes of ram  and a choice of 128 256 or 512 storage the phone  will be powered by a 3279 milliamp hour battery  with improved fast charging likely to be around  25 watts it's expected to support both wireless  and reverse wireless charging and it's also  expected to come with 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth  5.2 and ultra wideband support it will of course  ship with the new ios 16 when it comes to pricing  we are expecting a slight increase due to higher  component costs so we're expecting the base model  to start from 899 now next up we've got the iphone  14 pro with the iphone 14 pro we get a 6.1 inch  pro motion oled display it's a 120 hertz ltpo  display with a resolution of 1170 by 2532 which  gives us 440 pixels per inch on the front we get  another 12 megapixel wide angle camera with face  id sensors embedded in the display on the rear  we get a triple camera setup consisting of a 48  megapixel wide angle as the primary a 12 megapixel  ultrawide and a 12 megapixel telephoto and of  course we get the additional lidar scanner the  phone is going to be powered up by the a16 bionic  and it's coming with a choice of six gigabytes  of ram 128 256 512 or one terabytes of storage  the phone's going to be powered up by a 3240  milliamp hour battery with improved fast charging  likely to be 25 watts it's expected to support  both wireless and reverse wireless charging  and it's also expected to come with 5g wi-fi 6  bluetooth 5.2 and ultra wide band support it's  going to ship with ios 16 and the base model of  the iphone 14 pro is expected to start from 1099  so next up we've got the new addition which is  the iphone 14 max the iphone 14 max is expected  to come with a 6.7 inch super retina oled display  it's coming with a resolution of 1284 by 2778  while some sources are claiming it's a 90  hertz display there is still a chance it  could be a 60hz panel on the front we get a 12  megapixel selfie camera and on this model we  also have a notch and then on the rear we  get a 12 megapixel wide angle as the primary  and another 12 megapixel ultra wide but  unfortunately there will not be a lidar scanner  the phone is going to be powered up by last year's  a15 bionic although it will be slightly modified  and they could still market it as the a16 chipset  the phone comes with six gigabytes of ram and a  choice of 128 256 or 512 gigs of internal storage  the iphone 14 max is going to be powered by a 4  352 milliamp hour battery again with  fast charging likely to be 25 watts  it's expected to support both wireless and reverse  wireless charging and it's also going to come  with 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2 and ultra wideband  support of course it's going to be shipping with  ios 16. when it comes to pricing we expect the  iphone 14 max to start from 999 now finally we've  got the top end model the iphone 14 pro max the  iphone 14 pro max is coming with a 6.7 inch pro  motion oled display we're expecting a 120hz  ltpo display with a resolution of 1284x2778  giving us 458 pixels per inch on the front we get  a 12 megapixel punch or selfie camera with face  id under the display and then on the rear is the  triple camera setup and a lidar scanner the triple  camera consists of a 48 megapixel wide angle a 12  megapixel ultra wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto  the phone's gonna be powered up by the a16 bionic  and it's coming with a choice of six gigabytes of  ram 128 256 512 or 1 terabytes of storage the  phone's going to be powered by a 4 352 milliamp  hour battery with improved fast charging likely  to be 25 watts and again it's likely to support  both wireless and reverse wireless charging it's  expected to come with 5g wi-fi 6 bluetooth 5.2  and ultra wideband support and it will of course  chip with ios 16. the base model of the iphone  14 pro max is expected to launch from 1199 and of  course the highest storage variants will cost more  so overall the iphone 14 is looking  incredible and it's great to finally see  some drastic design changes in terms of the  hardware they've already got a good setup going  so focusing on design is a good move of course  the iphone 14 series is going to be launching  in september 22 and as more and more leaks  come in i'll continue to share them as they do  as always though i'd like to know your thoughts  in the comments so who out there is excited for  the apple iphone 14 and which model you're waiting  for but thanks for watching the video if you liked  it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next oneyou
VBsY8JsJI3w,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,
ZXxLTbhn3MQ,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"- What's up, guys?Saf here on SuperSaf TV.And it's the one you've all been waiting for.The SuperSafStyle camera comparisonbetween the iPhone 14 Pro Maxand the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.We'll be looking at all aspects to the cameras,front facing, rear facing, images, video,low light, everything.There'll be some timestamps down below.Let's get to it.So we're going to start off with imagesfrom the primary camera,and both devices do excellent in good light as expected.We've got lots of detail and great dynamic range.But one thing that I consistently foundwas that the iPhone doesn't mind clipping some highlightsin order to be able to brighten up the shadows.So in this example, if you look at the background,you can see that the iPhone has clip some of the sky,whereas the S22 Ultra has maintained that.But if we look in the shadow areas,the iPhone has maintained shadow details bettercompared to the S22.Here's another example.Again, the iPhone has clipped someof those highlights in the background,but if we look in the shadow areas,the iPhone is much brighter.So they clearly handle things quite differently,but overall, I'd say that both are doing an excellent job.You'll also notice in this imagethat we do have some more separationbetween the background and the foreground on the iPhone.Things are a little bit more blurred out in the backgroundand that's because the iPhone is now using a larger sensor,which I do like.Now, in terms of resolution,the S22 Ultra does have 108 megapixels,the iPhone has 48 megapixels.And you can shoot at that full resolution,although that's nothing to do with sensor size,just keep that in mind.So in this example, we are shooting at the full,maximum resolution of both devices.And you get a lot of detail, especially if you go in 100%,you can really see all of the intricate detailsof this EndoSkull on both devices.Now you'll be able to crop in further on the S22 Ultrabecause of the higher resolution.Now, for low light, this was quite interestingbecause both did perform pretty well.In this example, I do prefer the iPhone.It is just a brighter and overall better detailed image.Now in this image, things are pretty close.I would give the slight edge to the S22 Ultrawhich does have more detail in the shadow areas.This image, I would have to give to the iPhone.The S22 Ultra is just trying to make everything brighter,whereas the iPhone is giving you a much more balanced shot.Especially if you look towards the tree with the light,it has maintained a lot more detailcompared to the S22 Ultra.Now, in this example,I actually struggled to get the S22 Ultra to focus.So it was giving a blurry image.And the iPhone, thanks to that LiDAR scanner,can pin and focus very quickly and easily.Now, once I did finally manage to focus on the S22 Ultra,it did give a much better and detailed image,but I still think I prefer the iPhone.And the other thing that I noticedwas that the S22 Ultra consistently took a lot longerfor night mode shots compared to the iPhone,which opted for around two to three seconds.Whereas, the S22 Ultra usually went for about six.Now on the iPhone, you can go all the way up to 10 secondsif you want, so you can manually push that.And when you do that,you do get a much brighter image with lots more detail.So overall, I would pick the iPhone for low light.Now, another thing that Apple has been talkingabout a lot is the improvement in the flash.Now, personally speaking,I don't use a flash on a smartphone.I just have this switched off.However, Apple has actually done really well.You can see in this example here,Samsung tends to just pop a bunch of lights on everythingand does tend to wash things out.Whereas, the iPhone has a much more of a natural look.The skin tones, the black of my topand trousers all has been maintained better on the iPhone.Whereas, things are looking quite blue on the S22 Ultra.Here's another example.And I actually stood further back this time.And thanks to the more powerful flash on the iPhone,it still managed to expose me quite nicely,whereas the S22 Ultra has struggles.So big improvement if you are somebodywho likes using the flash.Right now, let's talk about the ultrawide cameras.So both of these have excellent ultrawide cameras.The iPhone is slightly wider compared to the S22 Ultra.And again, both do a really good job in general.However, the S22 Ultrain my experience does have better dynamic range.You can see in this example here.Although, both devices have blown outthe highlights in the background,the S22 Ultra has maintained more detail in the shadows.And in this example in particular,you can see that the iPhonehas clicked the highlights quite significantly,which I don't like.Yes, it's brighter in the shadow areas,but the S22 Ultra has, in my opinion,a better overall image where things are a lot more balanced.Now, both devices can shoot macro photosfrom the ultrawide camerasand they both do an excellent job with lots of detail.You can focus in a little bit closerwith the iPhone compared to the S22 Ultra,but generally speaking,I do like the detail on both images.Here, I just took an image of my hand,and look at all the little details in my hand.I mean, both are doing very, very good.Right, ultrawide images in low lights,I think both actually do really good.And the iPhone 14 Pro Max has improvedcompared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max.And in this extreme lower example, neither are doing great.The iPhone is a lot brighter,but that's at the expense of being very, very soft.The S22 Ultra is a tight sharper,but it's just not bright enough.Right now, one area we need to talk about is zoom.So both devices do havea 3x dedicated optical zoom camera,but the focal length is slightly different.So the S22 Ultra has a focal lengthof around 70 millimeters,whereas the iPhone has around 77 millimeters.So although technically both are 3x,the iPhone does get you in a little bit closer.However, the S22 Ultra has additional periscope zoom camerawhich will give you 10x optical zoom.Now, if we compare this to the 10x digital zoomon the iPhone, it is a big, big difference.The S22 Ultra is just giving you a much sharper image.The iPhone maxes out at 15x,whereas, with the S22 Ultra, you can keep going further.Here's an example at 30x,and you can clearly read the texton the sign that I'm holding.Whereas, on the iPhone, it's quite a bit of a struggle.Now with the S22 Ultra,you may know that you can go all the way up to 100x,which they call Space Zoom.Now, in my opinion, this is quite a gimmicky feature.If you are using it,you're probably going to be using it once every month or so.But it does work,and you can read this sign from that distance away.Let's just quickly switch back to the primary camera,which is at 1x, and look at the differenceof how close you can actually get.And although it's a gimmick,it is pretty impressive what you can get,depending on the situation.Now, although, you do get that extended zoomon the S22 Ultra, when it comes to low light,the iPhone just takes much cleaner images at 3xcompared to the S22 Ultra.Check out this example.You can clearly read all the texts on the iPhone.Whereas, it's a struggle on the S22 Ultra.Here's another example.Again, on the iPhone, things are a lot cleanerand a lot sharper.Whereas, there's a lot of processing going onon the S22 Ultra,and you can see some artifacts because of that.Now, I was a bit suspicious as to why this wasand I actually covered upthe 3x zoom camera in low light.And it turns out that the S22 Ultrain low light is not using the 3x optical zoom.It's just using digital zoom on the primary camera.And this is the reason why you're gettingmuch cleaner images on the iPhone.Now it seems like because of the factthat the S22 Ultra has two zoom cameras,the 3x zoom camera is just not as goodin terms of the hardwarecompared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Right, one of my favorite areas to look at, portraits.Now, both actually take excellent portraits,but Samsung has been using this AI depth algorithm,which gives you, I would say, the best edge detectionon any smartphone when it comes to portraits.And in this example, it might be difficult to see,but if you do look towards my shoulder,the iPhone has struggled a little bit there.So I thought I'd go in an areawhere it's got a very complicated background,and here you can see that the iPhone has missed outareas between my arms.Whereas, the S22 Ultra has absolutely nailed this.Now, with both smartphones,you can use the 3x optical zoom lenses for portraits,which I think give you more of a flattering result anyway.And here you can seethat both are doing an absolutely excellent job.Edges are pretty much perfect.You can see that difference in focal lens.So although both are technically 3x,the S22 Ultra is around 70 millimeters,whereas the iPhone is around 77 millimeters.But the iPhone has a new trick up its sleeve.And you can actually take portraits at 2x,even though there isn't a dedicated 2x camera.The way it does this is it pretty much uses the middle partsof that larger size primary sensor.And it actually gives you some really niceand sharp results.Now, if you've been watchingmy camera comparisons for some time,you'll know that Samsung actually did have 2x portraitson the S21 Ultra.However, they were really not good because it seemedlike there was some digital zooming going onand the results were quite soft.Whereas on the iPhone, they are using the middle partof the sensor rather than using any digital zoom.So it's the equivalent of optical zoom.Now, I'm sure Samsung could do this if they wantedwith a software update and use the middle partof that larger sensor, rather than digital zooming,like they're doing for low light images as well,but we'll see if they actually do this or not.Now, one thing that I do have to sayis that I do prefer the colors on the iPhone.If you look at the black of my trousers and my top,those blacks have been better maintainedon the iPhone compared to the S22 Ultra.Also, I'm looking a little bit more on the yellow sideon the S22 Ultra.I do prefer the skin tones on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Now a new feature that's Apple has introducedon the iPhone 14 Pro Max when it comes to portraits,it's foreground blur, not just background blur.So pretty much all smartphones right nowthat have a portrait mode just blur out the background.Of course, if you were usinga professional mirrorless or DSLR camera,there's going to be blur in the foreground as well.And Apple has tried to replicate this.And you know what?They've actually done a really good job.You can see here in this example that, yes,the S22 Ultra is giving you that natural blurthat you would do taking a normal shots.But on the iPhone, you can also edit this blurand you can change it to how you like,and that foreground has been blurred.This is a bit more obvious in this example.Again, you have more foreground bluron the iPhone compared to the S22 Ultra.And although the S22 Ultra has blurred some partsof the foreground, it's because it kind of thinksit's away from the subject.So that's the reason why it's blurred it.It's not actually blurred itbecause they are foreground objects.Right, low like portraits,something that you guys like to see as well.I think both are doing a great job overall.The S22 Ultra is brighter and it does have better edges.If you look towards my hair and my ear,the iPhone has struggled in this,whereas the S22 Ultra has got them almost perfectly.Here's another example at 1x.Again, the S22 Ultra is doing excellent in terms of edges.The iPhone has struggled towards my hair.Now, you can shoot portraits at 3x in low light as well.And the S22 Ultra is brighter,but you might already know why that is,is because it's not actually using the dedicated 3x camera.It's using the primary camera and it's using digital zoom.And because of that, yes, it's brighter,but the image is just very, very soft.Because the iPhone is using that dedicated 3x camera,you've got a much sharper result,although it's not as bright.However, I do prefer this.Now, remember, the iPhone can still do a 2x portrait,and this is using that middle partof that primary sensor, not digital zoom,and it's giving you a much cleaner resultcompared to what we've got on the S22 Ultra.So for portraits, it's interesting.The S22 Ultra does have the best edge detection overall,but you've got a lot more versatilityon the iPhone with portraits at 1x, 2x, and 3x,as well as features like that foreground blur.Right now, let's look at selfies.I think both take excellent selfies.The iPhone does, however, have more detail.Now you can get wider selfies on both.And the iPhone does have a wider angle of view,which I do prefer.And here's another example.This one's quite tricky situationwith a lot of light coming in from the background.And although both are doing pretty good overall,the iPhone just has more detail.Now looking at portraits from the selfie camera,both actually do really, really well.You can see that the separation here is excellent.Remember when I said that the iPhonehas a wider field of view for selfies?Well, this actually doesn't apply for portrait selfies.When you are taking portrait selfies,you can only take them at a fixed angle on the iPhone,whereas on the S22 Ultra,you can get that wider field of view with portrait mode,and it does an excellent job.Now, both of them do have autofocus,so you can get up really close if you wantor get in really far,and it's still going to give you a lot of detail,as you can see from this example here.I'm not sure why I'm sharing this.Now for low light selfies, both can use night mode,so you can get bright selfies,although it is pretty difficult to hold it stillwhen you are that close.And I think they do pretty well,although there's lots of processing.You can see towards my top, especially because it's black,you can see lots of artifacts there on both devices,and both also have a front facing flash.Once again, I think the S22 Ultradoes try to brighten everything up.And although you're getting a sharp result,it does look like I've kind of been hit with a lot of light.Whereas the iPhone's image is not as bright,but it's not as blind either.Right, we're going to move on to video.But just to quickly mention,if you're enjoying the video so far,be sure to subscribe and hit that bell iconso you don't miss a future coverage like this.Now, I'd like to saythat both devices do shoot excellent video.The S22 Ultra, I would say, has the best videoon any Android smartphone right now.And I'm going to sound like a broken record,but the iPhone is still king of video.If we look at some examples here in 4K,both are actually doing really good,but the iPhone just has overall better dynamic range,and especially in the shadow areas, you'll notice this.The iPhone also has HDR with Dolby Vision.And when this is activated,you get tremendous dynamic range.Now the S22 Ultra can shoot in HDR10+,but this is deep within the settingsand it's got a Labs signed,which pretty much means that it's a beta feature,it's not something that Samsungreally seems to want you to use.And even when you do have this on,the HDR on the iPhone is still better.Now, when it comes to low light video,again, the iPhone just gives you brighter overall results.It's less shaky compared to the S22 Ultra.And when you go into super dark areas,like you can see here, the iPhone is just much, much better.The S22 Ultra does have some tricks up its sleeve.It can shoot in up to 8K.So you get a load of resolution.It, however, does crop in quite significantlywhen you're using this,and it completely loses stabilization.So unless you're going to be having it on a tripod,I personally wouldn't be using 8K on the S22 Ultra.Speaking of stabilization, both of these actuallyhave great optical image stabilization.And you can see this example here,both are doing really well.However, I would have to give the edgeto the iPhone 14 Pro Max,which seem to have less jitters compared to the S22 Ultra.Now the iPhone does have a new action mode,which is supposed to give you gimbal-like stabilizationand it's something that Apple has been talking about a lot.The S22 Ultra has a similar feature,which we've had for around four yearsand it's not really changed in four years.In my opinion, it's still completely terriblebecause it shoots that 1080p,and the quality drops significantlycompared to when you shoot at 4K.On the iPhone, the action mode is way more stable,as you can see from this example, and it's a lot cleaner.You've got up to 2.8K,and you've got much, much sharper results.So when it comes to stability,it's an easy win for me on the iPhone.Now, for those of you who like shootingin 4K 60 frames a second, here's a quick example.Once again, I do feelthat the iPhone is more stable overall.Right, slow motion hasn't really changedon smartphones for the past few years.We do have 240 frames a second at 1080p on both of these,and both do pretty okay generally.I would say there's a little bit more processing happeningon the S22 Ultra,which does make it appear a little bit sharper,but I would call it a draw overall.Now, the S22 Ultra can shoot in super slowmo,960 frames a second for a quick buzz.This is that 720p, and the quality once again is not great,like I would never find myself using this.Sure, you can shoot that as slow motion,but there's no real reason to do thatbecause the quality is just so bad.Now from the front facing cameras,I actually think both are really good for videoif you are somebody in to vlogging.The iPhone just does have that better dynamic range,once again, thanks to HDR with Dolby Vision.It also has more detail, especially in the shadow areas,and it's wider compared to the S22 Ultra.Now, when it comes to stabilizationfrom the front facing cameras, it is very, very close.The S22 Ultra might just be a tad more stable,but that's because it's not as wide,it's cropped in a little bit,which does give it a bit more scope for stabilization.Right, cinematic mode.For the intro, you saw that I was using cinematic modeon the iPhone 14 Pro Max and portrait video,which is the equivalent on the S22 Ultra.And neither of these are perfect.There's always going to be some edges that are missed.However, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can do 4K nowcompared to 1080p.And I would say, overall,it just has sharper and better results.You can also edit the amount of blurand the point of focus after-the-fact on the iPhone,which you can't do on the S22 Ultra, it's all just baked in.Now, this does work from the 3x optical zoom camerason both devices, but I just didn't find the resultsas good as the primary cameras.And it also works from the selfie cameras.And I did prefer the iPhone overallbecause we do have 4K versus 1080p.On the S22 Ultra,there did seem to be a lot of post sharpening going on,which I also didn't like too much.Autofocus.Both devices are really good with autofocus, very fast.However, when it comes to low light,the iPhone is just so much better,thanks to that LiDAR scanner.It can snap-on focus very quickly.Whereas, as you can see on this example,the S22 Ultra did struggle quite a bit.Now, it does have an infrared sensor,which I was assuming would also be usedand help with the situation,but it doesn't seem to do much.Right, for audio, you guys can have a listen.Now, we've got audio test from the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultraversus the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Let me know what you guys think of how they sound.Do you prefer the S22 Ultraor do you prefer the iPhone 14 Pro Max?Now, I'm no audiophile, but both sound really good to me.I would say that the S22 Ultrahas better noise cancellation.If you want to go back and have a listen,there was a lot of car noise in the background,which the S22 Ultra did manage to eliminate.So to conclude,I think both of these have excellent smartphone cameras,some of the best out there.Of course, they have their advantages and disadvantages.The S22 Ultra, you have that extended zoom.You have better dynamic range on the ultrawide camera.And I would say you have some of the best edge detectionon any smartphone when it comes to portraits.The iPhone, on the other hand,I would say is a lot more consistent.It has better overall low light performance,especially when it comes to the Telephoto camera,and you've got a lot of versatility,such as with the portraits being able to shoot at 1x,2x, as well as 3x.And once again, the best video on any smartphone,with excellent dynamic range, amazing stabilization,and an improved and pretty usable cinematic mode.That's what I think anyway.What do you guys think?Do drop me a comment belowand let me know your thoughts.If you want to see lots of imagesfrom lots of different devices,then do give me follow on Instagram.I'm @SuperSaf.And if you enjoyed this video and you've come this far,then do smash that Like button for me.These camera comparisons take forever to do.So a subscription to the channel as well,if you want to see more like this, would be appreciated.Thanks for watching.This is Saf on SuperSaf TV.I'll see you next time."
pN-Aicuq1P8,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,is the iPhone 14 plus camera really thatmuch worse than the 14 pro Max well Ishot a ton of different photos andvideos to see how much of a differenceis there really and should you spend theextra money starting off with colors andcontrast I consistently saw that the 14plus was a little bit more saturated andhad a little bit more contrast addedwhereas the 14 pro Max it's a little bitmore true to life a little bit morenatural looking like in this shot righthere with that it also seemed to have alittle bit better dynamic range if youlook at that tree on the right hand sidewhere the 14 plus is slightly blown outand now let's get into what everybodycares about detail especially with that48 megapixel lens and in this normalwide shot you cannot tell a differenceand even if we crop in the difference isminuscule and that's because this is aregular photo not the pro raw switchingover to Pro Rod to get all that detailyou might actually think that the 14plus looks more detailed that is justbecause it has a lot more sharpeningapplied and I'll be honest the 14 plusdoes a great job but when we punch inlook at that the 14 pro Max looks somuch more natural with a ton of actualdetail from the image that was capturedcompared to the 14 plus that has someartifacting over sharpening worstdynamic range it basically looks likeyou're comparing a cell phone to a DSLRgoing back to Skyline now looks moredetailed and more natural and thenpunching in we have a lot of fine detailcompared to over sharpening now whatabout that 3x lens the 14 plus doesn'thave a telephoto so as a digitally cropbut I was surprised by how good it stilllooked the new photonic engine is doinga great job but we do see a dynamicrange difference if you look at theshrub at the top it is blown out on the14 plus whereas the 14 pro Max you havemore detail and it looks more naturalnow we also have the extra benefit ofbeing able to crop in more so the 14plus can only do a five times cropcompared to 15 but if I crop the imageafter the fact I mean look at thatdifference there if both phones are setto 5x there is a difference but it's nothuge and then our 14 pro Max and go upto 15 which is awesome and if wedigitally crop the image afterwards Imean it is insane what we see at the topright we have that STCU sign which isnot even visible on the other shot andif we take a look at a building likethis I mean one looks like a usableimage the other does not I love beingable to isolate a subject withoutgetting other stuff in the shot and thenif you're zooming in the same I mean itis crazy now Apple made a big deal aboutthe ultra wide but in my shots thedifference is so small a little bit morecontrasty on the 14 plus like before butif we look at a fine detail it is hardto see the difference in this toughermixed lighting shot they look so similarand even cropping in I wouldn't say thatthe ultrite is any better on the 14 proMax at least in the day a will cover thenight time in just a bit and switchingover to the selfie camera this cameraactually is identical on both phones soit looks very similar and then even herewe have a little bit more contrast inthe 14 pro Max but looking at the finedetail it is pretty much identical butthe one difference I noticed is that ifyou're shooting a portrait shot whichneeds a lot more computational powerthat is where the 14 pro Max starts tolook a lot better because of its a16processor now if you're gonna be buyingany of the new iPhone 14 models you'redefinitely gonna have to get a reliablecase like one of the new iPhone 14impact cases from our sponsor case defywhich are engineered with the newtwister design known as ecoshock whichprovides 20 increased protectioncompared to the previous generation upto five times the military standardwhich means it's been drop tested over130 times to ensure ecoshock doesn'twear off and they're sustainably madewith 65 recycled and plant-based onmaterials they're all very high qualityand they're now available with moreprints than ever before and you can getthem with magsafe compatibility for allof your accessories like wirelesschargers and wallets and of course weput the new Ultra impact case with theecoshock protection designed to the testby drop testing our iPhone 14 with itcoming out basically good as new sinceit has drop protection up to 11 and ahalf feet high so check out one of KSupply's new iPhone 14 cases using thelink down below and save 15 off yourorder today now getting into portraitshots which I love you guys can see thatthe 14 pro Max has a wider lens butotherwise they look very similar now onebenefit I love is the new 2x mode forportraits so here it looks more naturalon the 14 pro Max which on the 14 plus Ihad to walk closer so you see more ofthe background and Elon slightlydistorted and then switching over to thethree times telephoto lens his face isso distorted on the 14 plus because it'sstill that same wide length lenscompared to the 14 pro Max looks greatwith that you can't always get closerand you can't zoom in on the 14 plusbefore taking a picture so here I couldactually take a portrait shot and I alsofound that even though the 14 pro Max'scamera is wider you can be further backand still get a portrait whereas the 14plus cannot and even here where I'mreally far away the 14 pro Max let metake a portrait shot where we couldn'twith the other one and that is awesomenow not only is that 2x portion modeconvenient but it actually makes thelighting better as well because it'slooking at just that part now somepeople still say you know what take thephoto crop in so here we don't have thatconvenience and then once I crop thewhole image on the 14 plus just looks alittle bit fake a little bit too oversharpened not as natural as having thatextra lens so if you're somebody likesto take portraits you definitely wantthe 14 pro Max and with that it can alsotake macro shots like this one righthere with the 14 plus you're gonna haveto take an image like this and then cropit in and it's okay but look at all thatnoise and artifacting doing the samething with the 14 pro Max looks betterbut of course you could just use thatmacro mode to get all that fine detailwithout the noise now as far aspanoramas the 14 plus actually looksbetter the colors look better it's alittle bit more detailed and that's justbecause there's so much extra data thatApple has to use for the 14 pro Max withits 48 megapixel sensor so it looksworse comparing the dynamic range the 14pro Max is slightly better just like Ishowed you guys before and if we exposefor the sky both are fairly dark now wecan bring up the mids and some of thoseShadows but they don't look great butthe cool thing is with Pro raw you canbring all of that up and it looks muchbetter much more natural and moredetailed and now let's take a look atnight mode here I have an ultra wideshot when the sun has just set and the14 per Max looks a little bit cleanerstepping inside with the main camera so14 pro Max looks just slightly betterwith slightly less noise and testing out3x crop here I would say that the 14plus actually looks better this was bothnight mode is a lot dark in real lifebut the crop from the main sensor looksbetter than that dedicated 3x lenssurprisingly the same thing happens herethe 14 plus is crop is a little bitbrighter and has less noise than the 14pro Max but once it gets even darker the14 pro Max will actually do the digitalcrop as well and this is why this imagelooks more detailed with less noise nowthe killer feature of the 14 pro seriesis the lidar sensor which allows you totake night mode portraits when the 14plus you can't and depending on how darkit is the difference can be massive likethis shot right here and then evendarker here where you almost can't seeEmily with the 14 plus I also took aflash shot which I don't like doing butit does look nicer on the 14 pro Maxbecause of its sensor and then switchingto the ultra wide in a really darksituation we also see a big differencethis difference is noticeable in a lotof different situations where the 14 perMax is just way better and switching tothe main sensor here the differenceisn't huge but we see a little bit moredetail and a little bit more stars withthe 14 pro Max I have to say apple did agreat job with the added processing inthe same sensor from the 13 Pro lineupwhere it looks really close here on atripod for 30 seconds not much differentas far as nighttime selfies I wouldactually say I like the 14 pluses betterit has a little bit less color in myface and then when it's crazy dark theyare very similar take a look at video Ithought the 14 plus would look betterbecause there's less data that has toover sample but they are very similarprobably slightly sharper on the 14 proMax dynamic range is also very close butoverall I'm surprised by how close it isshooting with the main camera the detaillooks almost the same and then if wezoom in to three times which is themaximum that the 14 can do it looks justslightly worse than the 14 pro Max boththese can shoot cinematic mode and whilethey look very similar the 14 pro Max ismore accurate and as far as nighttimevideo when you still have some lightshining they look very similar but whenit gets darker the 14 plus does have alittle bit more noise especially if youlook at the bushes right there it'smoving all around and the image I thinkis slightly darker overall and for theultra wide camera I mean you can barelysee anything on the 14 plus with a 14pro Max has less noise and a brightershot and even though they both have thesame selfie cameras because of the a16you have a Brighter Image and a lot lessnoise in the face as well so should youbuy a 14 plus or a 14 pro max if youcare about photos and video well on thevideo side I think it's very close buton the photo side if you love takingportrait shots and taking Zoom shots andregular lighting the difference ispretty substantial and of course we havethat macro mode that allows you to getreally close to your subjects and thenhave an ability to take those large Proroute files that look more natural Imean I think overall if you care aboutphotos you should spend the extra moneyalong with all the other extra featuresthat you get so if you guys want to seeour full comparison you guys can clickright over

YQ0kr8eUDMo,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,is the iPhone 14 pro cameras really thatmuch better than the iPhone 13 Pro orthe 12 Pro Max well today we're going totake a look at a ton of different photosboth outside in the daylight low lightshots Raw photos Ultra wides andtelephoto shots as well as video qualitywith standard video cinematic mode thenew action mode and we're gonna see onceand for a while is the camera updatethat much better I took over 300 photosand also videos and I have a lot to showyou both good stuff and some not so goodwith these new phones I'm gonna split itup into different categories so let's goahead and jump in starting with colorsand contrast I found that the 14 proline really varies as far as thesaturation the contrast sometimes it'smore sometimes it is less and this shotright here is just way too much but ingeneral what I found is that it looks alittle bit more natural even though it'sless contrast and in some dark scenesyou see the shadow detail a little bitmore and also for now night mode shotsthe saturation is definitely boosted upbut I'll talk about that more in just abit as far as white balance the iPhoneshave typically been more warm in thisshot you guys see that but often I sawthere's actually more cool than theprevious generations in this shot righthere the 14 pro looks way better wherethe 13 looks the worst way too warm andin this portrait shot the 14 pro isactually the most warm but that'sexactly how the scene was in thismorning selfie you guys can see that myface is a lot more cool and here itactually would prefer the warmth of theother two phones and in this nighttimeshot the 14 Pros image is a lot coolerbut it is actually more accurate becausethat's the kind of lighting that we hadand same thing here the 14 pro looks alittle bit more cooler the face has alittle bit more shadowing whereas the 13It's warmer it's really flat in the faceI think that was the worst one out ofthe bunch now most YouTubers don't coverpanoramas and with this new 48mp pixelsensor I wanted to see if it got anybetter stacking all three with the 14pro at the top I would say that Iactually prefer the 13 pro has a littlebit more contrast and a lot less flaringthe 14 pro has a flare spot and the 12pro has all that contrast loss croppingin to look at the detail I would saythat the 14 pro looks the worst it isover sharpened even though it has alittle bit better dynamic range than the12 Pro I would take either of the olderones instead so no the 48 megapixelsensor doesn't really help it mightactually make it worse because of theextra processing needed one thing thathas plagued iPhones for a long time isflaring this is where many Androidphones really beat the iPhone so let'ssee if it got any better and even fromthis first selfie shot you guys can seea massive difference the 14 pro hasbarely new flaring the contrast is waybetter and the 12 Pro is just really badmoving to the main camera you guys couldsee that the flare spot right there inthe middle on the 14 pro is much smallerthan the other two and then I adjustedthe angle a little bit lower and now allwe have is a tiny little dot that iseasy to fix and then moving back to theolder Generations each one gets worselooking at the telephoto cameras we havea similar result with the 14 pro doingthe best and even around the sun we havebarely any flare spots so applesdefinitely improved that and looking atthe ultra wide we have a similar resultnice flaring control and this ultrawideshot that you already saw the 14 prodoes so much better not only do we haveway less flaring up in the sky but ifyou look at the bottom of the picture wehave no ring at all in the 14 pro asmaller one of 13 and a more visible oneon the 12 series now when it comes downto video there's less processing thatcan be done in software to remove it butwe still have a little bit betterresults for the video and with thattelephoto camera recording gets the sunonce again much better we're maintainingthat contrast less flaring whereas the12 series looks way worse so overall wehave a huge Improvement if you'd like toshoot against the sun to give you a niceglow you're going to be happy the onlydownside I would say is that in nightmode shots we still have all thoselittle dots from Reflections now Applelowers the brightness more so thanbefore but it is still there and nowwe're going to cover details startingwith this 48 megapixel main camera Iknow you guys are gonna be verysurprised I also have some tips for youguys now looking at these standard wideshots yes the shot's a bit wider on the14 pro but if we crop in you guys seethat there isn't much more detail infact I like the 12 Pro Max's image thebest and that is because when you'reshooting regular photos it is samplingeverything into 12 megapixel but lookingat these shots here they don't reallylook any better Apple talked about thatquad bearing and that requires a lotmore processing but the final result the12 megapixel images they don't look anymore detailed you guys see this portraitshot here now now when we get into lowerlight it does look slightly better eventhough it has less contrast and withsome Sunset shots here you also see thatthey look so similar and punching in itdoesn't really look that much bettereven this lower light condition Ipersonally expected that going from 48megapixels down to 12 would provide abetter image now one thing that didsurprise me are these 2x shots whichcrop into the sensor now being aphotographer that has shot over 150weddings and a ton of other shoots I'mreally against that digital 2x croppingthat Apple showed off so I didn't wantto believe them but even with this fullshot here I see extra detail andcropping in dang that looks much muchbetter than before and I think thatmight be because they're using less ofthe sensor they can use extra processingfor that and it looks great and becauseof that I've been shooting a lot more 2xshots and they look fantastic whereasbefore I thought I wouldn't use that atall now in order to get the full qualityfrom this 48 megapixel sensor you haveto shoot Pro raw and then when we cropin we see a massive amount of detaildifference compared to your standardquad beard shots comparing Pro rawagainst the older generation phones whenyou crop in you definitely see thatadded detail it looks much better herein the office I shot this one right herecropping and the image looks moredetailed it also looks more natural atthe same time and looking at this cropof vadim's face I mean it's sharper itlooks more detailed it looks morenatural it's better in every single wayand thanks to this new 48 megapixelsensor the photos look better thanSamsung's 50 megapixel and even 108megapixel photos in different lightingconditions so it is doing an amazing jobnow with that I also found that usingprora doesn't always show you as much ofa difference cropping in here yes it'smore detailed but it's not as dramaticas before and looking at this shot righthere looks a bit more natural on thewide and when we crop in we do noticethat we have more detail but the otherones still look kind of sharp becauseit's a lot of fake sharpening and thatis when I noticed that the raw imagesobviously look more natural but apple isnot applying as much contrast orsharpening so if you want to tweak thatyourself it still looks more natural andthat's when you really get that detailto pop I also found in situations wherethere's a lot of dynamic range ordenoising the raw shots don't look thatmuch better compared to the other twoand that's just because the other onesare over sharpened so as far as theextra details get from the pro right itreally depends on what else is going onwith the lighting and on the downsidethe files are massive going from Two anda Half megabytes up to 76 andunfortunately Apple doesn't let youshoot 48 megapixel without shooting Proraw now I talked about a way to convertit earlier but this awesome Twitter usercreated a shortcut which willautomatically convert it for you anddelete the other file we'll go ahead andleave a link in the video descriptionnow also found one very peculiar thingand that is if you are shooting in nightmode with prora yes it does look betterit does look more natural than the shotsfrom the previous phones you guys cansee that right here but when I placed itside by side with the same phone 14 proMax shooting hdic it didn't look thatmuch better in fact you had a little bitmore noise and then I found out thatwhen you're shooting in night mode withlong exposures it actually does not giveyou a 48 megapixel file it gives you a12 so it's way larger but as far as theadded detail and benefit of that Pro Rawit's not that big of a difference so ifyou're shooting in super dark situationsI would say just shoe heics now eventhough the other cameras are still 12megapixel I think you'll be surprisedwith the improvements but before I showyou that if you're a Mac User who doesany

difference but if we crop inwe do see a little bit more detail EveryGeneration Now Apple didn't even make agraphic when they presented the camerasbecause this is the only lens thatactually hasn't changed is the same as a13 Pro Max and in this medium lightingsituation it looks very similar but onceagain when you punch in you do see moredetail because of the new photonicengine and the processing now if you'resomebody likes to zoom in right here wesee a lot more detail on the 14 pro Maxand the same thing goes for this shot ofthe tower now in tougher lightingsituations we see so much more detailfrom the 14 pro Max it almost looks likea DSLR shot and with this crop shotright here you guys see it's huge thesame thing goes for lower lightconditions where the 14 pro Max looksamazing compared to the 13 Pro Max whichhas the same lens the only issue that Ifound is sometimes it does a little bittoo much processing and you have weirdartifacts like this switching to theultra wide even though I don't lookhappy here we have a lot more detail inthe 14 pro Max and the 12 looks bad nowwe don't always get these kind ofresults in optimal lighting thedifference is very little it's justslightly sharper and in some cases whenyou crop in it actually doesn't look anybetter and the same thing goes for lowerlight conditions where we don't havenight mode just the standard shot andnow for the selfie camera the 14 pro Maxlooks so much better whereas the 13looks flat and less detailed same thingfor lower light conditions the Selfieslook awesome now Apple finally addedAuto focusing to the front facing cameraand here you see that the background isactually sharp whereas the other twothey are blurred out so that helps ifyou're in an environment where you wantto capture that background but one thingthat I have found is that if you need atab to adjust your exposure like for asunrise or Sunset it was actuallykeeping me blurred out because now ithas focus with that so you have to becareful that you don't just tap you haveto use that slider I also found that the14 series detail isn't always that muchbetter and it's typically in situationswhere you have a big difference indynamic range and the processing isgoing towards that so with that let'stake a look at dynamic range startingoff with this same shot right here the12 from axis sky is completely gone butthe two two newer phones they look verysimilar this is something that I'vecomplained about for a couple yearsbecause Android phones can do a greatjob with those skies and same thing withthis ultrawide shot the sky is justcompletely gone where Android phoneswould actually keep that detail nowsometimes the dynamic range can actuallybe worse look right there the 13 Pro Maxlooks better and of course the 12 perMax it sucks I also found that the 14pro tends to boost up the Shadows wherepreviously my wife there is crushed andin this shot right here you also see alittle bit more detail in the darkerpart of that Greenery now the biggestdifference in dynamic range is this lookat my face in this shot on the 14 proMax the 13 Pro Max looks terrible and wesaw that before with the 13 in reallytough shots the same thing goes forselfies the 14 pro Max chose to blow outmore than the 13 Pro Max but my facelooks so much better so much morenatural where the 13 wanted to keep someof that sky but we looked terrible andthe last Improvement is in Greeneryshots like this the 14 pro Max's imagelooks like it came straight out of aDSLR camera whereas the other two thedynamic range is just pushed too much itlooks too flat now as far as dynamicrange for video it really has notimproved with the sky but if you areshooting a subject that's being exposedeven though we don't get better dynamicrange we don't have all that flatness ofthe 12 Pro Max and that's with a varietyof lenses like this main one here for asunrise the 14 and 13 looks similar the12 looks bad and the same thing for thisUltra wide shot right here where it'sjust pushed up too much making it lookflat now as far as close-up shots boththe 14 and 13 have that macro mode wherethe 12 doesn't and because of that youcan get really close using the ultrawide camera one downside though is thatit sometimes kicks in too early and thenthese shots the ones with the macro modedon't look good so if you're not goingto get that close I would suggest goingto the camera app scroll down and turnturn off the automatic macro so you cancontrol that yourself and then you canshoot a shot like this using that threetimes lens that looks good but with thatthe 2.5 still looks better from the 12Pro Max the 14 Pros have one moreweakness and that is minimal focusingdistance here you see that we cannot getas close with that three times lens andif we switch to the one time lens thedifference is huge you have to be wayfurther away to get Focus that isbecause of the new large sensor that isin here it is so huge that it requires abig lens which they can't put in andbecause of that look how much closer youcan get to an object with the 13 and the12. so now you will be forced to use themacro mode if you want to take shots ofdocuments and other things getting intoportrait shots it's surprising howsimilar a lot of these are with the 12being just slightly behind now I reallylike that 2x mode that I showed you buthere the 3x does look good on the 13 ofcourse we could do the same thing and itlooks really remarkably close with the12 having a little bit less detail nowin tougher lighting situations like thisone the 14 looks great as far as dynamicrange the white balance where the othertwo both look off and of course I can dothat 2x mode that looks fantastic andjumping up to the telephotos here the 12is the only one that's really fallingbehind not as far as the accuracy of theblur the 14 still misses like you guyscan see in this shot all of them lookgreat but they all have issues wherethat fences I've really put in the testin this shot and none of them areperfect I would say the 14 is justslightly better and then in this shotthe 12 actually did the best with thecutout now one feature that the newerphones have is the ability to blurforeground objects like right here youguys see that bush is blurred out we'reon the 12 you see it gives you a bitmore depth but it looks kind of fake inthis shot I prefer the iPhone 12 theimage looks sharp because the lightingwasn't difficult and the blur looksnatural because it is instead of fakeblur and then shooting here we actuallyhave a little bit of blur on the 12because of that distance whereas theother ones add fake ones and the cutoutsdo look better one thing that is reallyannoying when you're shooting portraitsis if it doesn't let you take the photoit just says your subject is too farwell here the 14 was able to take aphoto with blur whereas the other twowere not and it's the same case with themain camera as well you could be furtherback with the 14 and still get blur wearit with the others you can't and nowlet's stick with portraits but move overto night mode now when you have a goodamount of light like in this shot all ofthem look great even with the 12 samething with here they are very similarswitching to the telephoto lenses thatdon't capture as much light that's wherethe 14 starts to stand out and then samething with the 1X lens in toughsituations like here the HDR just looksplain better believe it or not but itwas almost Pitch Black in this shot butthey all look pretty good because theyhave the lighter sensor and they'reusing night mode with portrait it butthe telephoto lenses don't have thatability so in this shot right here whereit is really dark the 13 actually looksbetter and maybe even the 12 compared tothe 14. As for the front-facing camerawhen it's not too dark the 14 pro Maxlooks amazing with its new camera but ifit gets too dark none of them look thatgood yeah the 14 pro Max is better butit's still kind of blotchy turning nightmode off and using the flash makes allof the photos look a lot bettersurprisingly although the 12 actuallylooks the best Now Napa made a big dealabout their new Flash that's brighterit's more uniform so I decided to testit out even though I don't like flashphotos and here yeah it looks a littlebit better the newer phones are missingthat weird glow that are in the eyes andswitching over to the telephoto to getsome distance I would say that the 12 isthat much darker in terms of flashthey're all similar I thought maybe itwould help with the ultra wide for thatspread and yes it does look a little bitbetter a little bit less noise but Ialso think it's just the upgrade of thatcamera and now let's show fully intonight mode where we have some weirdnessgoing on now some of these images don'treally look that much better on the new14 for example here all of them lookgood same thing with this wide shot theyall look pretty good the 14 is notreally a big Improvement this telephotoshot as well the same thing goes withthese shots that have mixed lightingthey don't look that much better otherthan the 12 sometimes bringing up thatnight mode too far like we saw in thepast so that made me wonder why does itnot look that much better and then Ipaid attention to the night modesettings where the 14 pro doesn't eventurn night mode on whereas the other twodo now Apple's had the biggest lowlightImprovement was with the ultrawide up tothree times better and in this shot itdefinitely looks better and the crazything is it only took a second to takethat image compared to two on the 12 Probut unfortunately that is not always thecase for example here the 14 and 13 lookvery very very similar and that isbecause once again night mode is notkicking on by itself now because that Iwent in the settings and I forced it tobe on and this shot right here you seethat the 14 pro actually doesn't lookthat much better and that is becauseApple limited to seven seconds comparedto 10 seconds for the other one so eventhough this preview looks terrible oncewe get to those shots they look great onthe other phones now when low light getsextreme like here that is when we'restarting to see that low lightImprovement same thing with this shotright here with the grass we get moredetail with this telephoto Zoom thatdefinitely looks a lot better and inthis crazy shot right here I mean thoseare some massive improvements but it'sextremely dark now what impressed me themost was super dark shots with Skies youguys already saw this shot right herebut apple is adding color to the sky nowand in this shot on the tripod I mean itlooks so much better the colors thedetail it looks amazing with this Ultrawide as well it definitely has a bigImprovement and in most cases Astroshots they look great but sometimes itdoes get pushed up just a little bit toomuch like we've seen with pixel phonesand now for your video Shooters hasn'treally gotten that much better wellstarting out with the ultra wides we sawthat the dynamic range in this mode hasimproved quite a bit but as far as theactual quality it really doesn't lookthat much better the same thing goes foryour regular lens even though we have 48megapixels you don't really get anyextra detail in that so I did this testright here where we have a lot of finedetail and we can crop in and see thateven though the 12 looks worse the othertwo look very similar I might even haveto say that the 13 looks better becauseit has less stuff to deal with now asfar as the telephoto lens here they lookvery similar but if we focus on finedetail the 12 looks worse it doesn'tzoom in as much and then if we match upthe maximum Zoom we have a similarresult they're very similar and onceagain again I think the 13 looksslightly better and I also tested outthe slow motion function wanting it toget better but in reality I think italso looks worse than the 13 because ofthose extra pixels it has to deal withnow the Cinematic mode has been upgradedto 4K HDR and we definitely see moredetail and of course the 12 does nothave that I also tested out the threetimes lens and here it looks slightlybetter but not a huge difference the onething that has been improved is some ofthe accuracy where it keeps focusedinstead of going out and I think thecutouts have also gotten a little bitbetter now the one new feature is actionmode so right here I'm running with allof them and as you can see it isslightly smoother but is not a hugedifference and that is because withApple's marketing they showed off thecamera without stabilization compared towith action mode whereas other peoplethat are recording well you havestabilization on all of them and if it'sgetting a little bit darker then you'vereally notice the difference here I'mrunning sideways during this sunrise andeven though it's really smooth you cansee the quality is much worse but if yougo and turn on action mode and then youselect the 1X lens now it looks a lotbetter than it did previously now someof you guys asked for low light video soI ran some shots and unfortunately itdoesn't look that much better than the13 now the 12 does look a lot worseespecially if we switch over to thatthree times lens and the 14 is justslightly better with the main lens hereit is really hard to tell a differencebetween a 13 but compared to the 12 thenewer ones look a lot better and we havea similar result with the ultra widehere when it's dark you just don't havethe extra computational power that theyuse for photos so really it doesn't lookmuch better compared to the 13. now thefront-facing camera on the other handdoes look better with that new lens andthe autofocus you have less noise theimage is brighter and overall it's animprovement so there you guys goprobably the most detailed comparisonanywhere between the last threegenerations you guys let me know was itworth upgrading is it as big of adifference as Apple said on stagepersonally I like some of the HDR stuffwith the face looking a lot more naturalthings like that but overall I honestlywas expecting a little bit more of adifference click above to subscribe ifyou guys enjoy videos where we dive deepinto it and show you guys all of thetruths check out one of those greatvideos right over there that's been Maxand I'll see you in the next one[Music]thank you
4Q8z7VMt9YM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,the iphone 14 pro max is here and it hascome to challenge the current flagshipof smartphones the s22 ultra fromsamsung now this is a phone that isloved by a lot of reviewers includingourselves because obviously it looksvery nice and it has great performancein all aspects especially the camerasbut that is where apple has come withsome huge camera changes this year tochallenge it so in this video i'm goingto compare everything between these twophones the speakers the performance thedisplays the display quality batterylife and much more so let's get rightinto it now the nice thing about the s22ultra right now is that it is discountedand you can find it on amazon right nowfor 10.50 that's fully unlocked comparedto the 14 pro max which is elevenhundred dollars at least in the us sothey're very similarly priced but thecrazy thing is that you can even findthe s22 ultra refurbished as low asunder 700 dollars so that's a great dealif you have t-mobile now as far as thefinish i went with the new space blackfor the 14 pro max which honestly isn'tthat different compared to the previousgraphite at least on the back glass buti love how the new camera rings and thesides are just fully black so i'm reallyliking that new design especially thenew design for the flash module butlooking over at the s22 ultra i lovethis new camera bump design that theyimplemented it looks so much better thanthat previous chunky block that they hadespecially since they have four camerason the back and i'll talk about that injust a minute but in terms of designthey both look great now in terms ofcomfort they are a little bit differentbecause the iphone has these flat sidesand the s22 ultra kind of wraps aroundin a rounded design which feels reallycomfy however the corners are just fullyboxed offso that could kind of dig into your palmbut i do like how they have all of thebuttons on one side so you can see thevolume right here and the power buttonwhich is lower on the s22 compared to alittle bit higher on the iphone but onething that really sucks for us iphoneusers is that apple got rid of the simslot so that really sucks for people whoare traveling and they can't easilyswitch out a physical sim compared tothe s22 ultra which still has that simslot and you can even put up to twosim slots in some areas now as far asthe thickness of both of these phonesthe samsung is actually a little bitthicker in terms of the body the metalslab but because the iphones havemassive camera bumps that stick out somuch it actually is thicker if you'relooking at just the camera bumps now asfar as battery life the samsung doeshave a larger battery at leastphysically but in terms of the actualbattery life the iphone actually winsout because of the better softwareoptimization but surprisingly eventhough the iphone has a smaller batteryit's actually heavier than the s22 ultranow one thing that really disappoints meabout the iphone 14 pro max is that itstill has a lightning port no they havenot switched over to usbc which ofcourse the s22 ultra has and not onlythat but it's still lightning 2.0 withslower speeds even though it has a 48megapixel camera now before i get intoall of the massive display differenceslike the always-on display that you seeright here i do want to talk about myfavorite mac safe wallet of all timewhich has a built-in stand and grip thatyou can use in many different angles nowthis of course is our partner moth'ssnap-on wallet and stand which comes infour different colors that perfectlymatch the new iphone 14 pro colors theirpurple wallet matches the new deeppurple iphone 14 pro color they've gotthe beach white wallet to match the goldiphone 14 pro the misti cove walletmatches the silver model and the darkgray or black wallets match the spaceblack on the iphone 14 pro but if youwant to mix it up moft also has 15colors to choose from now what ipersonally recommend is getting the moftmax safe case because the magneticstrength basically becomes two timesstronger it is incredibly strong notonly for the moft wallet stand but alsofor all your other mac safe accessoriesand i also like how the white case kindof offsets the colors of the iphone thatyou can see through the transparentwindow and the matching wallet and maftalso has adhesive versions of the walletfor non-max iphones like the s22 ultraso check them out using the links in thedescription below now getting back tothe always-on displays finally apple hasone after so many years of not havingone and that's because it runs at onlyone hertz that means every second thedisplay refreshes just one time whichmakes it very efficient now the s22ultra unfortunately there are reportsthat it only goes down to 24 hertz evenin always-on display mode which iswasting battery life and impressivelythe always-on display on the iphone isreally bright like some people complainthat it's too bright but the maindifference is that you can actually seeyour wallpaperon the iphone at all times it just dimsdown and gets dark but it keeps thosecolors whereas on the s22 ultra you justhave an all black display now the iphoneis limited to just four customizablewidgets which you can also put thebattery life indicator just like the s22ultra has the better life on the bottomwhich is very convenient as well as along list of widgets and i also like howthey have the ultrasonic fingerprintlogo right here so you can just unlockit just like that but something new withthe iphone this year is that you canswipe from the always on display tounlock it which i'm very happy becauseyou used to have to tap to wake it upand then swipe so it's all in one motionjust like on the s22 ultra nowpersonally i love face id more than theultrasonic scanner because it works kindof transparently and it is very securein terms of facial recognition and onething i really love is that appleimplemented the face id into the newdynamic island so whenever you unlockface id or authenticate it all happensup there with the nice animation now onthe flip side the s22 ultra has a tinylittle camera hole which is so clean andit definitely gets in the way a lot lessthan the iphone does and some peopleonline have also been showing thedynamic island getting in the way of twoby one video which is so annoying and iknow that apple said that they reducedthe bezel size on the iphone but it'sstill just so much thicker than thereally thin and nice bezels on the s22ultra but i am happy that applesignificantly slimmed down the earpiecespeaker so you can almost just barelynotice it just like it is on the s22ultra and in terms of the actual displayquality the samsung has a slightlylarger display with higher ppi and interms of the peak brightness indoorsthey're basically the same if you maxthem out however if you go outside youcan see that the iphone's higher 2 000nits of peak brightness definitely helpyou see the display now this is veryinteresting the iphone's rated up to1600 nits while watching hdrbut the s22 ultra is actually brighterin this case so i don't know what'sgoing on why it's not going up to thefull 1600 but honestly the s22 ultralooks better for hdr video here and inthis case with them side by side idefinitely noticed a difference in thebezels being thinner on the s22 ultraand that single hole punch camera barelyintruding on the video compared to thedynamic island so basically for watchingvideo the s22 ultra is the winner butwhat about the speaker quality becausewe just did our 14 pro max versus 13 promax full comparison which you shoulddefinitely watch if you haven't alreadyand we noticed that the speakers had amajor improvement so let's compare themto the s22 ultra[Music]um yes it's the same song again and wowthat was a crazy comparison because thes22 ultra used to be better than theiphone 13 pro max but this 14 just wentcrazy in terms of the sound quality andthe volume so it's louder the separationof frequencies is much better in termsof the sound stage so you can actuallyhear the high end kind of cut away fromthe mids whereas the s22 ultra kind ofclashes everything togetherit doesn't do a good job of separatingthe different instruments and sounds andi also hear a lot more volume from thebottom speaker whereas the iphone isperfectly balanced between the earpieceand the bottom so i'm so impressed withthe iphone this year now before i getinto the performance testing i do wantto show off something that's totallyunique to the s22 ultra something thatthe iphone doesn't offer and that is ofcourse the s pen which is built into thes22 ultra i love that it's always therewhen you need it and of course you canuse it like a stylus for notes signingdocuments anything you want now gettinginto performance the first test we'regonna do is a geekbench 5 cpu test butfirst i've got to talk about theprocessor differences because the iphone14 pro max has the new a16 bionic chipwhile the s22 ultra has the snapdragon 8gen 1. now in terms of ram the iphone isstill unfortunately with only 6 gigs offaster lp ddr 5 memory while the s22ultra gets between 8 and 12 gigsdepending on your storage and this modelactually has the 12 gigs so double theram and let's run this test and wouldyou look at that difference apple justkeeps going further and further aheadthey're not letting anybody catch up interms of the single core we're gettingas much as 1873 that's 50 faster than the s22 ultraand for multi-core64faster i can't believe they have thisbig of a lead and with that said let'salso run the graphics test with gfxbench and the 1440p aztec ruins offscreen now while this is running i alsowant to talk about gaming because appledid say they improved the thermal systembut in our previous video comparing the14 pro max with the 13 pro max it'sstill dimmed now not as much but itstill did whereas the s22 ultra it doesan excellent job keeping the display atthe brightness that you set it to interms of gaming and other tasks andwhile we wait for the results i do wantto mention a couple of other specdifferences the iphone has a newbluetooth 5.3 compared to 5.2 on thesamsung and the water resistance is fourtimes better because it has ip68 at upto six meters compared to only 1.5 onthe samsung and there you go we have aresult and it looks like the iphone gets34 percent more fps than the s22 ultraand now let's talk about the cameradifferences the iphone has a new 12megapixel camera on the front comparedto 40 on the s22 ultra and then on theback they're very similar except thatthe samsung has a physical 10x opticalzoom lens which the iphone doesn'tbecause it's limited to 3x and it has108 megapixels for the main compared tothe brand new 48 megapixel main on theiphone now we're gonna be taking thesephones over the weekend and taking abunch of shots i'm gonna put themtogether and i'm gonna have max andangelica look at them blind not knowingwhich photo was taken with which phoneand i'm also gonna use the z fold for sothat is going to be a must watch ifyou're interested in the cameradifferences and now with all that saidand compared let's get to my finalconclusion now the iphone has a lot ofupgrades and advantages that we now haveover the s22 ultra that i really loveespecially that peak brightness and thespeaker difference and of course theperformance but the s22 ultra also hassome ways that it still beats out theiphone and it's nice that you can get itfor quite a bit cheaper than the iphonebut the final verdict that is gonnaleave it up to which one wins is gonnabe that unbiased camera comparison so ifyou're interested definitely subscribeby clicking the circle above so youdon't miss out on that video and watchour other videos right over thereincluding the 14 pro max versus 13 promax comparison thanks for watching andwe'll see you in the next video[Music]you
HDec1riK3M4,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,Hello everyone it's SpawnPoiint and today we're  unboxing and taking a first look at the new  iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max we've got the two  new colors here including the space black which  is my personal favorite and the Deep Purple I've  got these unboxed and then we'll take a look at  the colors design cameras and of course that  new Dynamic Island I'll then show you some of  the new features along with the cases I've picked  up now as I shoot all of the videos on my Channel  with an iPhone I'm really excited to see what the  new camera has to offer and how it will help my  future videos well the first thing you'll notice  is Apple have actually changed it up this year and  gone for white boxes for their Pro Models instead  of the usual black and the image on the front is  off the front of the phone this time showing the  notch at the top or the dynamic Island inside the  box we have the iPhone itself which we will set  up in a minute then there's the usual paperwork  and stickers and under that we've got a USBC to  lightning cable for charging it and as we're used  to now there's no power brick or earphones in the  Box okay so I've gone for the new space black for  my Pro Max and it's kind of a matte black rather  than gray or graphite that we've seen before but  on First Impressions this looks really stealthy  it's a lot darker than I was expecting it to be  in fact I definitely prefer this over my graphite  13 Pro Max but here they are together to give you  an idea of just how dark it is compared to the  graphite gray well the back of glass has that  same frosted look again and even the Apple logo in  the middle is a lot darker and it does a good job  of hiding the camera bump as well because that  again is quite dark looking around at the sides  there's the same still band that matches nicely to  that dark theme but it still mirror-like so it's  going to pick up those fingerprints the buttons  appear to be unchanged you've got the silent and  the volume buttons on one side and then we've got  the power button on the other now you might have  noticed I do have a SIM card tray on mine but  that's because I'm in the UK now if you're in  the US this has actually been removed and replaced  with an e-sim instead and on the bottom we still  have a lightning Port so no USBC on the Pro Models  again looking at the camera bump we've got three  lenses again including the new and improved  48 megapixel main a 12 megapixel Ultra wide  and a 12 megapixel telephoto lens but I will talk  more about the cameras in a couple of minutes and  here's what the iPhone 14 pro looks like in Deep  Purple now this one is actually for my wife so I  will not be using it at all but I'm actually  pleased that she chose this color as it means  I can check it out today so it was a lot darker  than I was expecting so it's more of a gray purple  rather than a bright purple and it could actually  pass as being a dark blue or even a graphite in  certain light but when the light hits it from  certain angles you can clearly see that purple  coming through now this deep purple does look nice  and it will likely be the popular choice this year  but on First Impressions I think I prefer the  space black so I am happy with the choice that  I made but what do you think out of these two  choices right now would you go for the space  black or the Deep Purple let's take a look at the  screen on this so the pro Max comes with a 6.7  inch screen while the pro model comes with a 6.1  inch but they both have the same OLED super Retina  xcr Display and the same resolution they both also  have the pro motion 120 hertz refresh rate HDR and  haptic touch now there are three big changes that  we've seen added to the iPhone 14 pro screen and  that's the new notch or the dynamic Island the  always-on display and the increased brightness  now the always-on display basically means the  screen will go into a kind of a reduced brightness  low power mode but it will still let you view the  time and see your notifications whether this will  impact the battery life I guess only time will  tell as for the brightness level well this has  actually been increased to 1600 nits in HDR of  outdoor use this has actually been increased to 2  000 Nets Peak brightness so that should make a  huge difference while you're viewing it outside  now having seen all the demos out there for  dynamic Island I'm genuinely excited to see  how this works I've only had this for a few hours  today but it actually works really well Apple have  taken a pretty boring Hardware feature their pale  at the top and made something of it so depending  on what you're doing whether you're listening  to music or setting a timer or even an incoming  call you can see the notch dynamically changing  and adapting to it at the moment not all apps  are actually optimized for this but I guess just  like with the iOS 16 widgets more and more will  add Support over the coming weeks but as this is  so close to the camera I can imagine you're going  to pick up fingerprints or smudges over time so  you'll probably need to wipe that front-facing  camera quite frequently on First Impressions the  notch does look smaller than the 13 Pro in terms  of its width but as it's further away from the  edge of the phone it definitely protrudes into  the screen space more using it for watching movies  or even gaming could be an issue especially if  you didn't like the notch before well as for the  cameras we've actually had a nice bump in quality  this year which we should see an improvement  in both photos and videos in fact this is the  thing I'm most excited about so we've still got  three lenses on the back including the brand new  48 megapixel main lens this is a 24 millimeter F  1.78 lens and the focal length on this is perfect  as I take all the photos on my Instagram with an  iPhone I can only hope the 48 megapixels is going  to make a massive difference then there's the 12  megapixel Ultra wide which is a 13 millimeter F  2.2 lens this is great for getting those nice wide  shots and it's supposed to be two times better in  lower light and finally the 12 megapixel telephoto  lens now this year they've actually given us two  focal lengths with this lens there's a two times  a 48 millimeter F 1.78 and a three times 77  millimeter F 2.8 it now means in the camera app we  can actually swap between 0.5 1 2 and 3 to get the  shot that we need of course with number two being  the new one I won't have any time today to go over  them all but there's obviously the normal mode  you would expect to see in the camera app and that  includes the portrait panoramic and macro as well  all of these look great but I will leave that for  my full review now the video capability on this  has also been improved which is awesome to see  so we still have 4K video at either 24 25 30 or 60  frames per second and we also have 1080P and 720p  now I've only used this for an hour today but from  what I can see so so far the video quality looks  really good it's hard to say if this is loads  better than the 13 Pro Max but I will definitely  need to do some more testing the Cinematic mode  has been improved from 1080p to 4K 30. so there's  now even more of a reason to shoot with that  mode then we have all of the normal modes like  HDR prores slow-mo and time lapse but another  big one for me is the new action mode and this  essentially is an improved stabilization mode for  sport or action shots now this is actually capped  at 2.8 K and 60 frames per second so you're not  going to get that full 4K quality although it is  still pretty good now this could potentially  replace the need to use a gimbal although it  definitely crops the shot quite tight so something  to bear in mind and a few other specs I wanted to  mention about the iPhone 14 pro well it's now got  an a16 chip up from last year's a15 a front-facing  12 megapixel camera with autofocus and one extra  hour of battery so that's now 29 hours versus last  year's 28 and here are a few cases I've picked up  for the iPhone 14 Pros I've got two official Apple  leather cases here so I've got the mid midnight  for the Promax and the ink collar for the 14 pro  and then I've got a bunch of other cases that  Spigen very kindly sent out so I've got a slim  one here which is a really low profile then there  are some armored cases for that extra protection  and even this transparent one so loads of cases  here to choose from and finally which is something  I always add is a screen protector now I know  these screens are supposed to withhold scratches  and drops but I'm not taking any chances so I'm  using this Spigen all screen protector you just  remove the film line it up and slide your finger  from top to bottom leave it on for a minute and  that's it it's done okay so as for the prices well  there are four color choices four storage options  and two screen sizes to choose from I've gone for  the one terabyte Pro Max which is an eye watering  1749 pounds or 1599 now this really does seem  overkill for a phone but as I said I do use this  for everything that I create then the pro model I  have here when I got that in 256 gigabytes and it  comes in at 1209 pounds or 1099 dollars like for  like the larger Pro Max is 100 pounds or 100 over  the normal Pro but here are all of the prices  for both options and sizes to give you an idea  so my first impressions of the iPhone 14 pro Max  well I like it I think it's a worthy upgrade the  slightly longer battery the awesome Dynamic Island  the always-on display and of course those improved  cameras that for me is the number one reason but  over the coming weeks I will do a comparison of  the 14 pro against a 13 Pro and whether it's  really worth upgrading I will then do a full  review of the iPhone 14 pro Max after I've used  it for a few more weeks but any questions you  have about either of these phones please let me  know now drop a 14 pro in the comments and I'll  give you a thumbs up for staying right till the  end and if you did enjoy today's video check out  my YouTube setup video next as that covers how  I film every video on my Channel with an iPhone  thanks for watching please like sub and follow  me on Instagram and Twitter until next time
qfnW2I_LBMw,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"- We have so much to talk about and so little time.Actually, we have all the time in the world.It depends how much time you wanna spend here chattingwith me about the new iPhone 14, the new AirPods Pro 2and of course the new Apple Watches.(upbeat music)Let's just jump right into itand start talking about the iPhone 14.So there's four new models of the iPhone 14.We have the iPhone 14, the 14 Plus, the 14 Proand the 14 Pro Max.The 14 is a 6.1 inch.And the 14 Plus is a 6.7 inch.Now both of these are running the a 15 bionic chipwhich is the previous iPhone 13 chip.So the only real upgradewith the chips is in the iPhone 14 Pro models.The 14 and 14 Plus do have improved thermal performance.So obviously this will help overallwith the performance of your phone.There's five colors, there's the midnight,star lights, blue, purple and Product Red.It has an XDR display that goes to 1200 bitsof brightness, ceramic shield front,and of course we have our 12 megapixel camerawhich has an f/1.5 apertureand this gives us a 49% improvement in low light conditions.I'm excited that they did update the front camera.So this now has auto focus.They're using this thing called the photonic engineand this will now allow you to get way more lightin low light photos.You'll get up to 2x improvementon the front and the ultra wide cameraand two and a half times on the main camera.There's also this new advanced action stabilization.So this is pretty cool because they feellike a lot of times when you're out filmingand you wanna get a super steady shot,you would have to use a gimble to be able to achieve someof these shots.Some of the demosthat they showed was actually pretty impressive.So that's something that I can't wait to try out.Now in typical Apple fashion, they like to remove things.Well, there's now no more SIM cards.Everything is moving to eSIM on the iPhone 14 series.They did show a little demoof how easy it is to transfer everything over to eSIMand almost all of the carriers will be supporting that.So that is happening with all of the U.S. models.There's two new big features, the crash detection.So if you happen to be in a car accident,your iPhone will be able to detectthat you were in a car crash and be able to call for helpwhich I think is such an awesome feature.And I'm really, well, I won't be testing that outbut I am excited for how many livesthat that could potentially help save.Something else on saving livesis the emergency SOS satellite feature.This was so cool to kind of watch the demo and I feellike this is gonna be something really funto kind of test out.I have been a huge fan of taking out satellite phoneswhen I go hiking and Apple developed this technologythat basically you're gonna kind of just hold your phone upand you'll be searching for the satellite.So your phone will detect where the satellite isand you'll be able to basically beam yourself up.They made this really cool interface thatif you are in need of help and assistance,being able to send text messages can sometimes take a lotof time because you are sending it directly all the wayup to these satellitesand it has to beam back down and then get to the person.And they developed this way that they're ableto make those text messages even smaller in size.So they should be, be able to send quicker.They also have a really cool interface that allows youto show what type of emergencythat you're having, select which one it is,and then that will help get you help quicker.The iPhone 14 is starting at a 799 price tagand the iPhone 14 Plus is at 899.Now for our Pro series,which is always my personal favorite,we have the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max.It comes in four colors.We have this space black, silver, gold, and deep purple.I mean the deep purple is obviously oneof my favorite colors.It looks so incredible, but I'm such a huge fanof gold as we can see here.So I'll probably order the gold phone again.I'm not sure.I don't know.Maybe I'll order the purple.I just don't know.I haven't decided yet.So the iPhone 14 and the 14 Pro have one huge difference.That is the not just still prevalent on the iPhone 14and the iPhone 14 Pro has this new pill shape design.Now, this is where I was so shockedbecause Apple had this thing that they decidedto call that pill shape designnot a pill shape, not a cutout,they called it a dynamic island.And when they said that, like the crowd waslike laughing because it's such a random namebut it's the most perfect namebecause it is exactly what it is.It is a floating island that dynamically changesas you open things on your phone,it will change to reflect whatever is open.If you're playing music, if you have a timer started,you can then force hold on that dynamic islandto open it back up and close it again.So it's kind of like another wayto show and hide notifications.Now that does have a Pro display.It has a 1600 nit brightness, which is sameas the Pro display XDR, but at its peak brightness,it goes up to 2000 nits, which is the maximumand that's twice as bright as before.We also now haven't always on display,which I know, Android.I get it.I know you've had it before.Well now we have it.And we are all here for it.And we are very excited.So please don't rain on our parade.We've managed to survive this long without it.So, you know, we good.So the new Pro phones are using the A16 bionic chip.And of course these are the fastest chipsin a smartphone to date.Now the six core CPUwhich is 40% faster than the competition.And it also uses 20% less power than the A15.The new Pros have a new camera system as wellwhich is always so exciting for me as a content creator.I love filming.I love taking photos.Here is our main camera.This has a 48 mega pixel camerawith their new quad pixel sensor.This has the second gen sensor shift optical imagestabilization with the 20 millimeter focal lengthin the main lens.Now the main camera alsohas two times better low light photo capabilitiesand you can also use Apple ProRAW.The ultra wide camera has an f/2.2 apertureand it has three times improvement for low light.It's also about a sharper lenswhich is way better for macro shots.There's also a new 2X telephoto, which is an f/1.78.This is pretty interestingbecause it kind of takes your main cameraand your telephoto and kind of merges them togetherand gives you this new two times shot.So you'll have your 0.5, your one, two and your three.They now have a nine LED adaptive flash.This is pretty cool because you have these varying rangesof focal lengths and your zooms.This will allow the flash to automatically adjust dependingupon how close you're shooting or how far away.So it's able to either be brighteror be a little less bright dependingupon your subject and what lens you're shooting with.So the Pros also can shoot in ProRes videowhich is really great, especially if you're an editorand you wanna have more control over the color.Also the action mode is coming to the Pros.So you'll be able to get super steady shotsin situations which would normally require a gimbal.Cinematic mode was something that they launched last yearwhich I don't really think I've actually really used itvery much since last year.I kind of forgot about it.And one of the reasons was because it only shot 1080 Pbut now you're able to shoot in 4k.So I think that's gonna kind of change the game for a lotof people who may have been a little hesitantto use it before.It's now 4k and you can shoot 30 frames a second and 24.Now it's really cinematic.The iPhone 14 Pro is starting at 999and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is at 1099and storage options range up to one terabyte.Next, we have Apple Watch Series 8.I am a huge Apple Watch fan.I've had once since the very beginning.And I'm so excited that they now announcethat it has a temperature sensorand for anyone who has a period, this is very excitingbecause being able to track that is tedious.Sometimes it's not accurate.And being able to have that temperature accuracyis really incredible for us.Also, for those who may be trying to get pregnantor trying not to get pregnant.So with that temperature sensor,being able to track your ovulation, track your cycles,I think this is going to be super helpfulfor a lot of people.The Series 8 is swim proof, dustproofand crack resistant.It also has the new crash detection.Much like the new iPhone,having the crash detection feature,the Apple Watch also now does have that feature.So if you are just wearing your Apple watchand you don't have your phone,crash detection will also be available on the Apple Watch,which again, hopefully something that I never needbut it is really great and kind of puts my mind at easeknowing that I have these devices in placeif something does happen.Series 8 has all day battery lifeand they do have this new low power modethat will be able to optimize to get you even more time.They said that you should be able to get upto 36 hours of battery lifewhen you're in that optimized mode.It comes in four different aluminum colors.We have the midnight, the starlight, the silver and the redand there's three colors of the steel.We have silver, gold and graphite.It'll be 399 for the GPS and 499 for cellular.They also made some updates to the Apple Watch SE.It comes in three colors, silver, midnight, and starlights.It still has all of the same safety featureslike the emergency SOS, fall detection, crash detection.It now has a 30% larger display than the Series 3.It has the same package as the Series 8.So it's now 20% faster than before.This watch I feel like is perfect for kids or family membersbecause you can use the family setup.So if someone doesn't have an iPhone,you'll still be able to enable this watchunder the family setting.This brings us to the brand new Apple Watch Ultra.Now I think that we thought this was gonna be calledthe Apple Watch Pro.There were rumors that it would have an additional button.It would be larger.This and that.Well, here it is.This is it.It's the Apple Watch Ultra.This is definitely a very extreme editionof the Apple Watch.There's so many features on here that I feel like a lotof people will never, ever use in their everyday life.This is definitely an adventure watch.This is for people who are going out,doing things, you're super active.I am definitely a very active person, but I feellike this might even be a little too much for mebut is that gonna stop me?Absolutely not.I definitely will be getting the Ultra to check out.I do love running.I do love doing all sortsof fitness activities and I do have also very small wrists.So when I first put this watch on,it definitely felt pretty large, but because it's madeof titanium and ceramic, it didn't feel heavy.It really felt very similar to the sizeof my other Apple Watch that I have now.And this is the smaller version.So going from this to the 49 millimeter was pretty shocking.Just the touch of the watch facebecause it's like a flat design now,it was really cool because it kind of feltlike you had a very mini iPhone on your wrist.It's ultra durable.It has aerospace grade titanium.The display is a flat sapphire crystal.It has a larger digital crown, and of course,this added action button that you can customizeto be whatever action you want it to be when you click it.It's got a second speaker for increased volume.It has cellular built in.It'll get you up to 36 hours of battery on a single chargeand you can get 60 hours of battery lifeafter a new optimization that is coming later in this fall.It has a night mode feature.So when you twist the dial,it will turn red and all of the blue light will disappearwhich will help if you're out in the middle of the night.This red is so much easier on your eyes.It also has precision dual GPS.So this will help with triangulating exactly where you areand it'll have way more precise GPS, especially if you'rein areas like you're running between buildings or you'rein various locations where there may be some interference.Sometimes the GPS doesn't work that well.So hopefully this will solve that problem.Now, we also got a little treat that was a little bitof a surprise.I mean, yes, the rumors sort of hintedthat there may be a possibility of some AirPodsand we did indeed get some AirPods Pro 2.Now I gotta a chance to test these out hands on.I got to listen to them and it was pretty incredibleespecially because I still use the Gen 1 AirPodsalmost pretty much all the timebecause I have such weird ear shapethat sometimes they don't stay in my ears,even the new threes.So still the first gen is still my favorite.So I was glad to seethat they have a new smaller tip on the AirPods Pro 2.So hopefully that'll help them stay a little bit betterin my ears, but the sound qualityon the Pros is so incredible, especially goingfrom the gen ones that I'm so used to listening to.Just the new adaptive noise cancellation.I'm excited to get my hands on themor get my ears on them.I'm, yeah.So the design is very similar to the previous Prosbut they do have a brand new H2 chip.Like I said, they have the new, extra small ear tip.They have the adaptive transparency mode.This will just safely for high decibel noises.I also tried this out at the event and it was coolbecause you could actually look at your Apple Watchand you could see the decibel sound changes and sayingthat you were now in a safe zone when I had the AirPodsin the noise cancellation mode.So that was kind of cool to really see real timean actual change happen.They've got some touch control.So when you squeeze the little bottom of the AirPod,it will actually switch from noise cancellationinto off again.You can also adjust the volume by sliding up and down.Pretty intuitive and I'm still pretty impressedhow great they sound.They also have a longer battery life.So you'll get about six hoursof listening time on a single charge, which is 30% better.And you'll get a totalof 30 hours of listening time with the case.They added a speaker at the bottom of the AirPods now.So when you use find my AirPods,you'll be able to hear them way better than beforewhich is so smart because I lose my AirPods all the time.And I'm sure I'm not the only one.I do normally find them though.They added a little lanyard connector hereso you'll be able to connect a lanyard.So not only will be able to find your AirPods,hopefully they'll still be connected to youand you won't have to look very far.These also have personalized spatial audio capabilities.Now this is not, I guess, a new technologybut it's definitely new for Apple.Sony's had this for a while where you scan your earand it'll basically give you a personalized spatial audiothat will represent the shape of your ear.Not only sure how this all worksbut it is kind of interesting.And I know that it's coolbut Sony has done that for a whileand now Apple has decided to follow in their footsteps.And I can't wait to scan my ear, like I'm ready,here we are.Let's do it.Scan time.So that my friends was kind of a first lookat everything that Apple announced at their event.I'm definitely excited about the new iPhone.Obviously, that's kind of what I look forward to every year.So I'm looking forward to checking that outbut I am kind of excited about the Apple Watch Ultra.Now, I feel like I don't do that many intense activitieslike most people who would get this watch would.I think the coolest feature is they were talkingabout how incredible this is for divingbecause as soon as you would dive into the water,it would automatically detectand you'd be able to detect the temperature of the water,how far you're diving,and I think that's just so cool.And I think this watch is really gonna change the gamefor a lot of people who do that typeof high active adventure activities.So I'm super excited to watch reviewsof people who really will push the limits of this watch.Let me know if there's anything specificthat you would like me to test out in any of these devices.And if you guys are new here, hello.Hi, I'm Justine and I am obsessedwith tech and I'm a huge iPhone Apple fan.I have a bunchof other videos that you may be interested inso be sure to go check those out.And if you haven't already, please subscribeand hit the bells so you'll be notifiedwhen I post new videos.I look forward to making a bunch of fun, new videos.It is officially tech seasonand I will definitely be making a bunch more videosin the upcoming months.So with that, I

9JW-ouXxrIM,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"So Apple will officially launch the iPhone 14 lineup on the 7th of September and willsell it on the 16th of September.We know everything there's to know about the handset so let's take a look at the top 5new features the iPhone 14 Pro will get this year.Apple is doing away with the notch for the iPhone 14 Pro lineup and will include notjust one but two cutouts on the display.The circular cutout will house the front-facing camera and the pill-shaped cutout will includethe Face ID hardware.Honestly, in a world of small punch hole displays in Androids, these cutouts on the 14 Pro arelaughable but it helps Apple to set the phone apart from last year's Pro models andThe iPhone 14 Pro and Max will finally get always on display, 6 years later than theirarch-rival Samsung.However, Apple's implementation will be a tad different than Samsung's.Instead of giving you a black screen with the clock and widgets, Apple has decided tojust dim the screen.Yes, once the user turns off the screen of the iPhone 14 Pro, the wallpaper will switchto the “Sleep” version where users will see remnants of their wallpaper and information,such as the time and their lock screen widgets, even when their display is not in active useand will return to full brightness when the phone is unlocked.But how this affects the battery life and screen burn-in remains to be seen, though.Speaking of always on display, the iPhone 14 Pro will have 120Hz displays which is nothingnew but what's new is the LTPO panel.Unlike the iPhone 13 Pro which has a variable refresh rate that varies between 10Hz and120Hz depending on what you're doing on the phone, the iPhone 14 Pro will go all the waydown to just 1Hz thereby saving crucial battery life when the phone doesn't need to displaymore than 1Hz such as when viewing still images and while on the always-on display.Now before moving further let's talk about the sponsor of this video NordVPN.You see the market is full of VPNs but NordVPN is by far the best one out there.I prefer it for its simplicity and that they have optimized servers which means your internetspeed barely gets affected.It will allow you to access blocked websites, unlock regional Netflix content, and more,but most importantly it keeps you safe from hackers and government agencies as it securesyour internet traffic, encrypts it, and routes it through a remote server.Specifically, it allows you to send your internet traffic through not just one but two VPN servers.If you're someone that truly wants to surf anonymously and securely this can be highlyvaluable.It's available on android, ios, mac os, windows, and Linux and you can use up to six devicessimultaneously within one subscription.There are three plans to choose from standard, plus, and complete so go to nordvpn.com/techtalkto get a two-year plan with a huge discount plus 4 additional months for free, the linkis in the description.The front camera of the iPhone 14 Pro will get two big upgrades.The first one is a bigger aperture bumping from f/2.2 to f/1.9.This has two benefits.A) a shallower depth of field which would make the photos as well as the videos muchmore pleasing to the eyes.And B)It results in the sensors capturing more light which should result in better low-light photos.The second big upgrade is the autofocus which would result in sharper images across a rangeof distances.But this isn't something new in smartphones.Samsung introduced autofocus on selfie cameras with the Galaxy S8 5 years ago back in 2017.Even though the number of rear cameras will remain the same, there will be some significantupgrades under the hood improvements.The iPhone 14 Pro will get a 48MP main camera, which finally makes a change from the 12MPcameras Apple has used for years.Apple is rumored to be using a larger 1/1.3-inch sensor, up from a 1/1.65-inch sensor in theiPhone 13 Pro.Overall, the sensor area will increase by 57 percent, which is why the rear camera modulewill also get bigger.Apple will likely use 4-in-1 pixel binning technology to output 12MP images for betterlow-light sensitivity and performance.Not only that the phone can also record 8K videos for the first time and finally, Applewill also upgrade the telephoto camera from a 6-element lens to a 7-element lens for improvedtelephoto images.Of course let me know your thoughts and as always I'll see you tomorrow...peace out"

6d8EgwCh4x4,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,"So even before people get the opportunity to  get their hands on the new iPhone 14 lineup,  Apple has gotten itself into big trouble that  will effectively ban the iPhones altogether  including the iPhone 14 lineup in this key  smartphone market. You see removing the  charger from the inbox content of the iPhones was  a controversial decision and even today, 2 years  later it's still a controversial decision because  Brazil’s Ministry of Justice has banned iPhone  sales across the country including the iPhone 14  lineup. The primary reason for this is Apple's  decision to stop including a power adapter with  the purchase of new iPhones. And not only that,  but Brazil has also fined Apple $2.4 million each  day it breaks this ban which means if Apple stops  selling iPhones or starts bundling the chargers  with the iPhones then it won't see this ban.   Apple tried to argue that they did it for  the environment as it reduces carbon wastage.  But you, I, your dog, and even the  Brazilian ministry know that this is...  Brazilian authorities didn't buy Apple's  explanations and argued that Apple could have  taken other measures to help the environment, such  as adding USB-C charging support to its iPhones.  Brazilian authorities have also stated that  Apple has not shown if removing the charger had  any of the environmental benefits that Apple  claimed to justify its move. So they decided  that selling devices without a power adapter is  a ""deliberate discriminatory practice against  consumers,"" and banned the iPhones in Brazil until  Apple decided to include chargers with them.   Apple said that they will appeal this decision  saying ""We have already won several court rulings  in Brazil on this matter and we are confident that  our customers are aware of the various options  for charging and connecting their devices""  Now you might wonder what about Samsung? Since  they're also not including the charger with  their new phone then how come Samsung phones  aren't banned in Brazil? Well, the reason Samsung  phones aren't banned is Samsung directly worked  with Brazilian authorities to bundle pre-orders  of new Galaxy phones with a gift charger.   Moving on, one of the interesting features of  the iPhone 14 Pro is the dynamic island. It  effectively camouflages the pill cutout with  information on things like notifications,  calls, timers, music, and more. Now the  beauty of the Android platform is that it’s  much more open to third-party app developers.  So an Android developer has already made a  Dynamic Island-style notification area for an  Android device. As you can see, it successfully  manages to hide the pin-hole selfie camera  in the corner when the Island is expanded.  Now, Xiaomi hasn't approved the design  just yet but don't be surprised if they  are the first ones to come up with  something like this officially. Now,  I don't think Samsung would implement this on  their flagships because this would ruin the  experience for selfie cameras. As you'd need  to wipe the camera down every time you use it  but you never know. They have copied Apple in  the past with chargers, headphone jacks, and all  so I won't be surprised if it happens again.  To see Samsung making fun of Apple and the iPhone  14 Pro for the 4th time click here and I'll  see you tomorrow...peace out"
YgxakQaAlSs,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,hi everyone Aaron here for zollotech and  this is the iPhone 14 plus this is the  last iphone 14 to launch this year and  it's the larger size which now replaces  the mini so we'll unbox this set it up  and take a first look now this comes in  at 899 dollars goes up to 1199 however if  you buy it unlocked meaning not through a  carrier it's an additional thirty dollars  so we have three different options 128 256  and 512 gigabytes this is the blue color but  we have purple midnight Starlight and red or  product red now let's go ahead and open this  up this is the 128 gigabyte model you'll see  it says iPhone 14 plus so let's open it up  we'll compare it in size to the 14 pro Maxand we'll open the bottom partand let's go ahead and open the box so we can see  inside here's the 14 plus in blue and it looks  pretty much just like the iPhone 14 just sort of a  little bit bigger let me set this aside we'll take  a look at what's in the box so just typically like  we have every year since this year we don't have  a SIM card it says you no longer need a physical  SIM card activate your esim during iPhone setup  and we have a warranty card and then an apple  sticker also we have a charging plug so we have  USBC to lightning and that's it we don't get  a charger in the box and I'll link some in the  description if you want to check them out now  let's go ahead and take the cover off the phoneand we'll set that aside now this is the less  expensive phone this year so it means that it's  made out of aluminum so we have aluminum around  the outside edge or aluminum depending where you  live we have a power sleep wake button on the  right side a millimeter wave antenna on the same  side and then some antenna lines on the bottom of  course we still have lightning although next year  we may have USBC we have a microphone and then  a speaker and also an antenna line and then on  the other side we have volume up volume down  and our silent switch nothing on the top now  the front is ceramic shield and we have glass on  the back with wireless charging with magsafe and  two cameras instead of three cameras now if we  take a look at the 14 pro Max next to it you'll  see the size is very similar however the size  of the 14 plus is similar more similar to the  13 Pro Max so the overall size is very similar  there and you'll see side by side they're very  close but the 14 plus is ever so slightly narrower  it seems but not very much of a difference you can  see the camera bumps are significantly different  we have a much smaller one on the 14 plus and of  course it doesn't stick out as far either since we  don't have the upgraded cameras to 48 megapixels  so very similar there and of course we don't have  the dynamic Island on the front we still have the  notch now let's go ahead and we'll turn it on and  this comes in at 7.16 ounces or 203 grams let's  boot it up here give it just a moment and this has  a 6.7 inch display similar to that of the 14 pro  Max however it's not the 120 hertz display with  a dynamic Island instead it's a 60 hertz display  at 2778 by 1284 with 458 pixels per inch so very  similar in resolution overall but it doesn't go  as bright it goes up to 800 nits for regular use  as opposed to 1 thousand nits on the 14 pro Max  and up to 1200 nits with HDR video instead of 2000  with the 14 pro Max so we'll go ahead and set this  up we'll swipe up here we'll bring a phone nearby  so now we'll bring the little QR code in it says  getting things ready and we're going to move the  SIM card from this phone to this one so I'll show  you how that works so now I have to put in the  passcode of the other phone now it's asking me  to transfer the number via an esim we can transfer  now or set up later let's go ahead and transfer  and it says transfer your sim to this iPhone  so we'll go ahead and tap on transfer number  now you can always transfer it back later through  the cellular settings it says confirm transfer on  your other phone we'll hit ok now it says  confirm transfer we double click the power  sleep wake button and it will confirm the transfer  and transfer the esim from this phone to the other  so it says finish on the new iPhone you'll see  at the bottom it says activating so we'll give  that just a moment now it says cellular setup  complete we'll tap continue and now we'll set  up face ID so this is just like any other phone  with face ID we'll tap continue and we can set  it up tap on get started and just put your  face in the frame and move your head around  and usually we have to do it twice or we can  use face ID with a mask or don't use it we'll  set it up for don't use for now and tap continue  now we can transfer the data so we can download  from iCloud or we can transfer it directly from  the phone typically transferring from the phone  is really nice but it takes a long time if you  download from iCloud it's usually a little bit  quicker and you'll see it says it will start  or it can start using your iPhone in about 15  minutes so we'll do that for now we'll wait for  it to set up the Apple ID and let's get things  moved over now it says make this your new iPhone  and we'll bring everything over tap on continueit's going to set up Apple cache and all of your  different cards that you use and this is one of  the new features it has crash detection built in  using the accelerometer and other sensors and it  says press and hold for emergency SOS crash  detection and coming fall 2022 emergency SOS  via satellite that's probably arriving with iOS  16.1 after you put in your account information  now it restores from iCloud so we'll give it a  moment to complete and then we'll continue now  everything's restored it's restoring all the  different apps right now but now we're at the  main home screen and so it's actually copied over  the wallpaper here and let's go ahead and take a  look at the wallpapers we have and what version  this is on so if we go to settings then we go  down to General then about you can see it came  pre-installed with version 16.0.2 so this is the  current public version I thought maybe we'd have  16.0.3 but it came pre-installed with this one  if we go back and go down to wallpaper let's see  what we've got so we can add a new wallpaper and  built in of course we have featured if we scroll  down we've got our Collections and at the end we  have the new wallpaper for the current phone so  if we go in here we have midnight you can see at  the bottom as we swipe to the right we have  Starlight red blue and then purple so we'll  switch it to Blue we'll just hit add for now  we can customize everything a little bit later  we'll hit done and now we're on this wallpaper  so that's the pre-installed wallpapers that come  with it and this feels very much like I'm using  an iPhone 13 Pro Max so very similar other than  its weight because it's aluminum and it feels very  lightweight and now one of the major updates the  Apple said with this phone is that it has the best  battery of any iPhone however that's a little odd  because it actually doesn't have better battery  than the 14 pro Max depending on what you're doing  so it has a 4 325 milliamp hour battery and apple  says that's good for 26 hours of video playback  however on the 14 pro Max they say it's good for  29 hours of video playback but if you go to the  music playback or audio playback it's good for a  hundred hours on the 14 plus and only 95 on the 14  pro Max so it really depends on what you're doing  as to whether or not it will have the best battery  life however because it doesn't have promotion  and it doesn't have an always on display that  may really improve battery life but will have to  test that over time now one thing that's a bit  disappointing for some people is that this has  last year's processor from the 13 Pro Max the  a15 bionic not the upgraded a16 so as a six core  CPU and a 5 Core GPU with a 16 core neural engine  it's super fast no issues there but it's just last  year's processor so that may just be disappointing  for some if we go into geekbench we can see how  much RAM we have and every single phone this year  appears to have about six gigabytes of RAM so  5.54 gigabytes according to geekbench so that's  good that all of the phones have that but for  some reason we still have the older processor  but that seems to be more than enough to handle  this display and everything else going on with it  now the cameras do get an upgrade this year  the forward-facing camera gets upgraded with  autofocus so if we spin this around let me take  off my glasses here and let's switch to video  now we're recording with the forward-facing camera  of the iPhone 14 plus so this gives you an idea of  what it looks like what it sounds like and it's  keeping pretty good autofocus overall so I think  it should be a great camera I've been using it in  different videos and in fact every video where I  appear in it is actually filmed with an iPhone  14 pro typically and it's the same camera so it  looks pretty good so let me know what you think  of that in the comments below and then of course  with the camera we do have rear cameras with 12  megapixel sensors we don't get a 48 megapixel  sensor in this but we do have an F 1.5 aperture  on the main camera and then the ultrawide has an  F 2.4 we have the photonic engine this year and a  couple different features so if we go into camera  switch it around here to the back camera you'll  see 4K 30. we have 4K cinematic mode this year so  we can switch over to 4K and 30 frames per second  and also 24 frames per second but we also have an  action mode so if we go into video you'll see  that we have this little icon here tap on it  and it gives us an action mode so as we move fast  or the phone is actually jiggling around it should  stabilize that footage as you can see here so as  we move quickly it really stabilizes the footage  but you do go down to 2.8 K so that makes a little  bit of a difference but you can upscale that in  any editor other than that the cameras should  should be better when it's dark out but again it  shouldn't be any different than what we have with  the 14. so the 14 and 14 plus are basically the  same phone to give you an idea of size compared  to an 11 Pro Max just in case you haven't seen  one of the newer phones the 11 Pro Max is still  heavier due to its stainless steel construction  but feels a little bit smaller because it doesn't  have the squared off edges but it's still a little  heavier at 226 grams versus 203 however overall  it's a little bit narrower a little bit shorter  and it's about the same thickness very similar  but in general the 14 plus feels like a little  bit bigger phone and definitely a lot lighter  but it's very very similar as far as everything  else even though it has a larger display now  you can see we have a bunch of fingerprints on  the back so I would recommend a case or skin or  something else but these feel very similar as  far as what we've had for the past few years you  really feel like the newer phones have all of the  great features however the 14 plus seems to have  some good ones but for a thousand dollars I would  probably opt for the 14 pro over the 14 plus but  that really depends on what you're looking for  of course we have ip68 ratings for six meters  for 30 minutes and that's about it nothing is  really different compared to last year's phones  we have upgraded cameras a larger size and we no  longer have the mini but let me know if you have  any specific questions in the comments below I'd  love to answer any of those as many people may  be looking at this are you going to be picking  up a 14 plus are you going to opt for maybe the 14  pro Max the 14 pro or something else let me know  in the comments below if you haven't subscribed  already though please subscribe and if you enjoyed  the video please give it a like as always thanks  for watching this is Aaron I'll see you next time

CBiEhMyGSpc,Iphone 14 Pro Max ,Apple,if you just upgraded to one of the newiPhone 14 models or you're thinkingabout buying one then you definitelyneed to buy a case to protect it andthat's why I have so many cases right infront of me so what I'm going to do inthis video is go through some of the topcases that we've used for the iPhone 14lineup and tell you why we like them andit's not only going to be me because theother co-host Max also has some toppicks for cases that he likes himself sohe's going to do the second part of thisvideo now the first case I want to getinto is the snap case from moft and thereason we chose this one because it hasby far the strongest magnets out of anycase out there just check this out I'mgoing to show you how strong these areit could literally lift up this chargingstand just like that watch compared to acompetitor's case where the magnets arejust not as strong and the main reasonwhy that's important is because ifyou're going to be using Mac safeaccessories like the the moft walletlike I always daily carry this has avery very strong connection so that'sgreat for all your macsafe accessoriesso of course you'll find a link to itdown below just like all the other casesI'm going to show you in this video nowmoving on to the next case we have thisnice leather case from Toro but it'sactually not fully leather because onthe inside it's basically like a nicesilicone case however they have a slabof leather all around right on the backwhich basically gives it a nice feel andby the way this is genuine leatherstitched right to the back and of coursethey have the camera bump protectorsover here so if that's something you'reinto you can check out one of these twocolors using the link below and Idefinitely like this leather feel whileyou have the grip of the silicone on thesides now moving on to the next one weactually have a ton of cases from thesponsor of this video encased and by theway each one of these cases comes with ascreen protector in the box which is ahuge value in all these cases range fromabout 15 to 20 ish bucks so they're inincredibly good value now the nice thingabout these cases is that all of themare very rugged and durable so they'regoing to protect your iPhone even downto the translucent transparent case andit even goes up to one like this that isinsanely rugged with a built-inkickstand and a built-in protector onthe front they can also get very simplelike this nice silicone case which hasthis nice felt material on the inside orif you're a lady you can get thisclassic one and they also have ones likethis which actually has a built-inwallet with multiple areas for your IDyour cards and even a lanyard and thisone actually covers the front of theiPhone as well with some compartmentsfor cash cards everything they've alsogot this one which you could literallyslot in credit cards and it has a littlespring to hold it in this one right herehas a nice little band so you can justgrip it like this this so overall withthese cases from encased I'm surprisedby the build quality so check out thelink down in the description and pincomment below and now those first fewcases out of the way I'm going to turnit over to Maxall right guys so you know that I'm nota fan of thick big cases I know thatsome people like them they serve apurpose but personally this is myfavorite case it's the pataka mag easycase 3 which is made from 100 genuinearamid fibers and that is whatbulletproof vests are made of so youliterally have that on your phone nownot only does it look super cool but Iloved last year's version because of howthin it was and I don't know how but theupdated version is 33 thinner and 27lighter being less than one millimeterthick so it is the thinnest and lightestMax save compatible case in the worldnow with that you still have protectionon all four corners and you have thisraised camera lip to protect your lensesthey also have a few densities to choosefrom or if you want a little bit of poplike me they have their Fusion weavetechnology which is literally coloredfibers sewn in instead of like manycompanies that just do a painted printon top now some people love the designbut they want more protection so that iswhy they made the mag easy case Pro 3which isn't that much thicker or heavierbut it uses TPU for air pockets for thatshock resistance and it has fullcoverage all around and they alsoseamlessly fuse the aramid fibrous andthe TPU together which I guess isextremely hard to do which is why mostbrands don't do that at all and you havegaps now the next one isn't as nice butit is also super thin which I love thisis totally's ultra slim minimal case nowI don't know if you guys can see thatobviously this one's partiallytranslucent they have different colorsbut it is insanely thin I'm not sure thematerial it's made from it's not goingto give you that crazy drop protectionbut it does have this camera lip that'sa little bit tougher so it will protectyour camera lenses and then with thatyou do have a little bit of a raisedEdge on the front but this thing is likealmost not having anything at all youguys see how thin that is compared tothe phone itself it weighs nothing so ifyou want a little bit of protection fromscratches on your stainless steel on theback and protect your lenses but youdon't want something that's going to addextra thickness heaviness anything likethat extra width so if you wantsomething minimal I don't think it getsany more minimal than this now they alsohave one which is slightly thicker it isstill a lot thinner than other casesthat are this style this is a flexibleversion so you get a little bit addedgrip because the material is differentand you get that full clear you knowkind of design but with that it is stillnice thin and minimal so we'll add a lotof heft to your device now if you wantsomething that has a little bit moreprotection some more features andactually a lower price we have ESR gearsclassic kickstand case here so as youguys could see it has the maxafe magnetsbuilt in they call it Halo lock it hasstronger mag safe than regular Applecases not as strong as the moff case butstill nice and strong it has thesebumpers and they say it has militarygrade protection that's a little bitthicker because of that a little bitless flexible and the really cool thingis that it has a kickstand built in inthe actual camera bump that you need tohave there to protect your lenses itdoubles up as that so typically what youwould have is like this Taurus casewhich is also not bad and my dad lovesthis case as this big kickstand that'sstrong but it gives you an extra bumpover here a little extra thickness extraweight so why not have that built in toyour camera right there so you can setit up at an angle you can watch videosand then close it up this thing is allmetal so it is durable now of course onething with these clear cases is it'sreally hard to avoid those fingerprintson them they really pop out especiallywith you know a color like my red hereso if you want something that won't havethat issue and it will give you evenmore protect section we have the nilkincam Shield slim now I bought this casefor one reason and then I saw some othergreat reasons to have it and that is thefact that it has that camera Shield somost cases almost all of them have yourcameras exposed now they'll have thatlip which this one actually has a lipthat sticks out even more so because youhave the sliding thing but what aboutwhen you drop it and it was a rock onthe ground right if you wereconstruction or whatever you're doingyou need the extra durability bam youclose that sucker up and now no matterwhat it falls on your lenses arecompletely protected now with that thisthing is a killer value and the qualityfeels a lot nicer than I expected forthat price it is very durable your phonestays in there like crazy I'm talkingabout it's kind of a pain to take it offI mean you could do it obviously but itreally grips your phone it has a decentraised lip all around how has thesebumpers right here the buttons actuallypressed surprisingly easily so eventhough I bought it mostly for thisfeature right here uh I think overallfor the price it is a great case now forthis last one I don't know how much youguys are going to like it and when Ifirst saw it I was like why wouldsomebody even make that up but my wifeloved it so this is the zve zipper caseit's very inexpensive surprisingly andas you guys could see it literally has azipper on here so while most uh casesyou know they'll have a couple thingsfor cards maybe on the back this one hasa bunch of slots it literally has thesesections that pop out and you literallyzip it up so my wife has used one ofthese for a little over a year now andnow this is for the 14 pro Max and shethrows change in there or receiptswhatever else zips up and you are notgoing to lose whatever you put in thereholds on nice you have some protectionall around buttons not too bad to pressat all I think they have some differentcolors that last year she had one thatwas slightly different and of course ifyou drop this sucker well when you'regonna drop it you're gonna go like thisit gives extra protection against thelenses because you have this fat thingsticking out here now they also do giveyou this little lanyard so if you wantto use a lanyard you could do that italso has RFID protection for your cardsso it's not something that I would wantto use because I keep my phones in mypocket but for my wife that doesn'tanyways a lot of ladies they have tinyPockets this is something that works outreally well for them so there you guysgo those are our top cases we chosebrands that we like we chose cases thatstand out because they have some uniquefeatures some are really low price someare more on the premium and a little bitmore expensive but obviously you have alot of materials that cost a lot moremoney to makeum so you guys let me know if you guyshave you know other cases or which onesyou guys liked the best go ahead andclick that Circle above if you guys wantto subscribe if you guys enjoyed thisvideo check out one of those

qWIkBMNKj1s,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,[Music]so what do the early 2000s san antoniospurs and the current day phoenix sunsand the galaxy s 22 series all have incommonwell they're all drama-free they're allkind of a bit boring and all quietlyreally really goodso those spurs weren't really just aone-trick pony of being more athletic ordunking all over the top of people orjust shooting tons of three-pointers orreally any of the things that a casualfan would immediately appreciate justgood solid fundamentals ball movementhigh percentage shots and sharing theload same kind of thing with the phoenixsuns of today they don't necessarilyhave one huge standout mvp superstar butlike the whole team is really reallygood and there aren't really anyweaknesses and they're quietly thenumber one team in basketball this phoneis boring like i'm not the only onewho's thought that and said that butthat's what happens when a phone gets soreally good across the board that therearen't really any weaknesses becausethey didn't really take any huge risksthey just took a good thing and made itbetter so i appreciate that you knowwhat you're getting with a samsungflagship very similar design to lastyear just a little bit smaller and alittle more squared off and with glasson the back now instead of plastic thatlittle spot where your finger restsunder the camera bump too if you use itwithout a case it's a little more sharpbut i got used to that pretty quicklybut we all expect an ip68 waterresistant phone solid speakers clickybuttons the best ultrasonic fingerprintreader in the game a nice satin finishyou know not all of these things can besaid about every other phone but they'reall here and i even want to give a shoutout to the in the hand feel of thesmaller galaxy s22 so i talk about inthe hand feel all the time but samsungmade both of these phones smaller thanlast year the s22 plus went from 6.7inches to 6.6 diagonally still big butthen the smaller s22 went from 6.2 to6.1 inchesanddare i say it has a bit of a compactfeel to it now obviously it sounds crazyto say that about a phone that still hasa six inch screen but the fact that i'mcoming from bigger phones combined withthe flat sides and the tiny symmetricalbezels and the corner to corner displaythis has me feeling like it's about ascompact as the phone can possibly be andi'm almost tempted to have it in therunning for maybe compact phone of theyear maybe it just holds that lead forright now in february but speaking ofdisplays that's the one thing that wedefinitely know samsung two have beengood at for a long time this year thoughthere was a bit of confusion around themso let's clear that up so both the s22and s22 plus have flat 1080p 120 hertzadaptive ammo led panels the plus isobviously bigger and it also has thehigher max brightness of1750 nits where the s22 gets up to avery respectable 1300 nits they're bothvery viewable outdoors although the peakbrightness on the bigger phones and alsothe ultra is crazy bright like you canview it in direct sunlight it's awesomebut there was a question about whetherthese were ltpo displays or not sothat's that newer tech that allows youto modulate the display refresh ratedown to 10 hertz to save battery so i'dask samsung and i mentioned this in theimpressions video that they told me thatthese are not ltpo displaysbut then at the same time on the specsheet it also said that these go from 10to 120 hertz so that was a bit confusingbut now a few days later if you checksamsung's actually changed those specsheets and their website saying it cango from 48 to 120 hertz so theyclarified that data transfer rates tothe display can go as low as 10 hertzbut the display is still refreshingfaster so they updated their site toreflect the widely recognized industrystandard of the actual refresh rate huhit's almost like some other companiessometimes lie to people by expressingthings in other non-standard waysanyway so it's not the full variablerefresh rate range of ltpo2 like we haveon the ultra which is a bit of adownside to an 800 to a thousand dollarphone but aside from that it's a greatbright responsive display in thisadaptive mode and that's what mattersmost to me i did notice there's stillsome situations and still a few appswhere it kicks down to 60 hertz onpurpose like maps apps like waze andgoogle maps and still the galaxy storeapp for some reason but with all thecolor customization and a really goodauto brightness the only possibledownside with this screen would bebattery life and on top of that the onlyconcern for me really going intoreviewing these phones was the batterylife because number one both the phonesare smaller and so both of them have a300 milliamp hour smaller battery thanlast yearand number two the new snapdragon 8 gen1 chip had some concerns about it it'sthat's obviously brand new and supposedto be very efficient but it also appearsto be geared to be a very high-end chipvery high performance so it performsreally well puts up great numbers betterthan previous chips on benchmarks and itcrushes gaming but it runs a little hotand if there's a reason almost everyflagship you see coming out with thisnew chip also has like a huge section intheir presentation about their newmassive super innovative new coolingsolution so with no ltposmaller batteries and a potentiallyhigher power drawing chip i was a littleconcerned about battery life on thesephonesturned out to befinenot amazing not like headline making butsan antonio spurs boring levelgood so david was testing the s22 plusmost at the studio and got a solid dayand a half of use so starting a day at 700 am and then getting to 1 pm the nextday before the battery dies pretty solidand i was using a smaller s22 for a fewdays and had no problem ending a normalday with 10 to 20 percent left now if idid a lot of high brightness navigationand gaming big power draw stuff i couldtake big chunks out of this battery fastso that did not surprise me with thischip it is a more efficient fournanometer process node now so it doesreally well with standby but you canabsolutely burn through it with heavyuse something to keep in mind too thoughthe s22 plus has a better overallbattery experience because it alsosupports 45 watt fast charging insteadof the 25 watts on the smaller phone nowit doesn't come with it so it's 50 bucksextra to get that 45 watt charger butthat's a difference to note you wannaknow something i did find i like lessabout the s22 though than last year it'sa subtle one but it's real the vibrationmotorso the haptics are still actually reallygood and really strong and clicky andresponsive and i love that about it butthey've switched from a z-axis vibrationmotor to an x-axis vibration motorit doesn't sound like it make a hugedifference but that's a difference inthe direction of the pulsing of themotorand that makes it a lot less strong inmy pocket and on a table for feeling thevibrations i missed a lot ofnotifications just because it didn'tstrongly buzz me enough[Music]so yeah i don't know that was a subtlething you can still feel the vibrationsreally well and turn vibration intensityall the way up but the direction isdifferent not sure why maybe spacesavings but it's real maybe the mostexciting potential superstar upgrade onthese phones though isthe cameras the s22 having a majorcamera upgrade would be like the 2016golden state warriors signing kevindurant making them the clear number onefavorite right you have a new 50megapixel main camera a 10 megapixel 110degree ultra wide and another 10megapixel 3x telephoto camera but thisnew camera system is moreharrison barnes than kevin durantmeaning it's it's really good but it'snot gonna blow your mind at how good itis i love that we take photos this goodfrom a smartphone for granted you giveit pretty much any normal lightingsituation and handles it really wellsamsung's colors are nicely balancedthey've hit their stride with processingthat isn't too overly sharp or saturatedthe ultrawide is definitely softer thanthe main camera but it still does wellwith a lot of light and the telephoto isrock solid no weird hdr haloing issuesand pictures no white balanceinconsistency problems no auto focusissues and pretty minimal shutter lagit's justboring tim duncan with the bank shotlevel solid also i i gotta say i lovethat it no longer punches into 3x when ishoot 8k video on the phone i know akvideo is not the most popular featurebut last time the higher resolutioncamera was the telephoto so if i shot 8kvideo it would punch into a 3x cropthat was rough it doesn't do thatanymore now it's just a tiny crop in onthat main sensor which is actually asmaller crop than on the ultra becausethe ultra is cropping into the middle 33megapixels of this massive 108 megapixelsensor so i'd actually rather shoot 8kvideo on the regular s22s than the s22ultra now i'm not going to do it becauseit's still 24 fps whichis the wrong frame rateshopped.onbc.com but still like whycouldn't samsung add a little switch tomake it 8k 30 if i wanted to the lastthree snapdragon chips have been able tosupport 8k 30fps video and i know youknow 8k is supposed to be a super highend cinematic feature but at leastburied in the settings let me do ak-30if i want toi don't know maybe it's a samsung thingother phones have been able to do itnot samsung now there are way moresoftware improvements with these cameraslike night photography which samsungcalls knightography because they have toname everything for some reason butthat's for better detail and night shotsand ai stereo portrait mode improvementsfor better cutouts and space zoomstability locking and auto framing thatcan track up to 10 faces around a frameand a new separate expert raw app i'mgoing to talk way more about all thiscamera stuff in the s22 ultra reviewvideo which is coming soon definitelymake sure you subscribe to see that onewhen it comes out but in this one iwanted to talk about its default statuswhich you know especially in the u.snow it's kind of a running joke thatoutside of the tech community we'veheard people call it like iphones andgalaxies like they've just been sodominant here anyway that it's kind ofalready understood but especially withthe s22 series now more than ever it'ssort of solidified itself as the defaultandroid phone uh which is crazy when youconsider what the pixel 6 was supposedto be now i used to rag on samsung'ssoftware for being incredibly clunkyweighted down with bloatware lookinglike a cartoon skin on top of androidwhile the pure google experience from anexus or a pixel or even a lightweightskin from motorola or oneplus was theway to go but today now that oxygen oshas gone downhill and the pixels are abuggy mess samsung's one ui has evolvedinto easily one of the most stableperformant feature-packed androidexperiences out there they loop in thegoogle stuff when it's good like havinga google page next to your home screenand the new material you wallpaperpicker from android 12 which lets youpick colors from your wallpaper to beaccent colors and the menus of yourphone but then they also sprinkle intons of their own samsung features thatyou can decide to use if you want butnot only that samsung has also vaultedahead and is doing some things betterthan google's own phones so one thingthat i've noticed is there's a newgoogle messages app as the default onall these samsung phones which is coolif you go to the play store and try todownload google messages it says youalready have it installed but when youopen it it's a samsung skinned versionthey're the only ones who have been ableto do that so now it has that halfscreen reachable ui to match the rest ofsamsung's one ui then there's a newgoogle duo feature that launched whereyou can essentially watch a youtubevideo together with someone while on avideo call like apple did with shareplay over facetime and this feature haslaunched in google duoon the galaxy s 22s only firstwhy so you have to use a galaxy s22 ors22 ultra to use this feature which idid we tried it and it worked but thereis no timeline for when this featurewill show up on other android phonesincluding google's own pixeleven though google made this feature andthen on top of that samsung is promisingfour years of software updates for thegalaxy s22s after they launchthat's more than the three years ofsoftware updates that google ispromising with their own phone in thepixel you see what i'm getting at so thegalaxy s 22s are boring yes but theboringness comes from them havingbasically no glaring flaws and makesthem incredibly easy to recommend i wishthey were more sustainable i wish theyincluded a charger in the box so youdidn't have to go out of your way to buya 45 watt charger and make more waste toactually use that feature and i canappreciate that some plastics being usedin the phone are made from recycledfishing nets but that's really only atiny dent in the big picture ofsamsung's footprint but in that classicfrequently asked question of like ifyou're in the market for a flagshipphone right now and i don't knowanything about youthe first phones that i'm gonna bring upare the iphone 13 and the galaxy s 22plusand they've earned that spotthat's been it thanks for watching catchyou guys the next onepeace
vXIAB_1FEC0,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,[Music]hey what's up mkbhd here and this is thebrand new galaxy s22 ultra i've beenusing it for about two weeks now and ipromise you i'm not going to call thisthe note 22 ultra over and over again inthis review i swear i can make itthrough this video without making thatjoke but really the bottom line here tounderstand this phone the best really islike if you took the name off of thisphone what samsung is giving you for themoney is a galaxy note but the phonethat i'm reviewing and using is calledthe s22 ultra let's get into it so theword ultra in samsung's lineup hasbasically come to just mean the highestambitions the biggest numbers the bestspecs and the most features overall it'sjust that now the ultra name hasswallowed up the note stuff too so noteused to be that one special editionphone with the squared off design theflat top and bottom and the pen built innow that's just all wrapped up intoultra and the s22 ultra does not miss abeat with all the ultra stuff they'repacking in the highest end ship they canthat's the snapdragon 8gen one here inthe us with a massive new coolingsolution alongside it the ram istechnically down from last year the basemodel has eight gigs and all the resthave 12 and there's no more 16 gigversion but i honestly don't miss that ican't imagine someone really needing 16gigs of ram in their phone right now butyou absolutely can go up to one terabyteof non-expandable storage though butthis display this display is alsoexcellent it's a huge 6.8 inch 1440pammo led at 120 hertz with a 240 hertztouch sample rate and the big new numberis a max brightness of1750 nits now on the one hand i don'twant to overreact about 1750 nits likeit's a big number but brightness workson a logarithmic scale so this 1750 isnot dramatically brighter than the 1500max from last year's s21 ultra thesephones are all very sunlight readablebut i do still want to give samsungcredit for continuing to improve analready best-in-class display and makingit even better it still got the samegreat ultrasonic fingerprint reader aslast year right under the middle of thescreen and still has a hole punch camerain the top middle and it's an ltpo2panel now which means in addition tobeing really responsive it can drop thatrefresh rate as low as 1 hertz whenthere's nothing moving on the screenreally my only dislike with this displayis the curve over the edges so if youlook at this phone next to last year'ss21 ultra obviously these phones aredifferent shapes and the displays areactually slightly different resolutionsand this new shape definitely curvesmore over the sides which i don't likeas much other than that this is anawesome ultra display and we all knowit's not an ultra without a massivebattery so yeah 5000 milliamp hourshould do the trick now interestinglythere are some tests online showing thatit doesn't last as long as last year's5000 milliamp hour battery and you cansee a roon mister who's the boss did avariety of things in his test and foundthe s21 ultra did last a bit longer thanthis phone and to me when i see that i'mlike okay there's a variety of factorsthat can contribute to that one theslightly better display two a little bitmore of a power hungry chip that runshotter in the snapdragon 8 gen 1but generally my battery experience hasbeen very very good i actually neverkilled it in a day never really gotanywhere close easily ending heavy dayswith 30 40 plus percent battery left andcould extrapolate about seven hours ofscreen on time out of a charge which isgreat for me i know screen on time isdifferent for everyone but it's beengreat plus on top of that it does chargea bit faster than last year up to 45watt peak charging if you buy that fiftydollar optional brick so i'm glad theyfit that big 5000 milliamp hour cell inhere despite also adding the s pen whichtakes up a whole column along the insideof the phone but speaking of that s penthat's what's new the note stuff now i'mpersonally not the biggest s pen user ithink i say this every time i review anote like i think i signed one pdf lastweek with it which was really convenientbut you know i did it once and i usedsamsung's handwriting recognition in thenotes app super cool that it worksreally well and you can search whatyou've writtenand i alsoi just enjoy that itstill clicks a lot like that so it isdefinitely impressive i still think it'sthe best stylist in any phone and it'sliterally got all the features the lastnotes had smart select is nice forscreenshots and annotating things lockscreen quick notes are still superconvenient if you use samsung notes andit even still has that long distancebluetooth connection that lets you usethe button on the s pen to remotecontrol take photos without touching thephone and the new display brings latencydown from nine milliseconds which isalready pretty good all the way down to2.8 milliseconds which to mebasically feels like real time you knowi'm not an artist who's doing massivedrawings or extremely precise sketchwork with the pen it's just casualwritingand so the fact that it uses ai topredict where the pen is going to go andstarts drawing those pixels slightlyahead of where the panel is actuallyregistering it is pretty next level soto me this this is as close to one toone as it gets but at the end of the dayif you see all this and you're like istill probably won't really use any ofit then you can just slot the pen rightback into the phone andnever use it it's out of the way and thephone didn't make any sacrifices toinclude it so okay here's a bunch ofother smaller things that i noticed fromusing this phone every day that youshould too if you're planning on gettingone so the speakers are excellent theyget very loud and sound crisp and clearlike last year some of the best in anysmartphone so that's great for watchingmedia but then the display curving moreover the edges than last yearmakes it worse for watching videos andthen the vibration motor this is a smallthing but i mentioned it also in the s22review they changed the type so it wentfrom a z-axis vibration motor to anx-axis vibration motor it doesn't soundlike much but it changes the way itfeels so it feels just as strong andprecise and clean for typing or swipingor holding it in your hand but it's wayless strong when it's on a desk or inyour pocket so i literally missed phonecalls with my phone sitting right infront of me vibrating on my desk becausei didn't hear it or feel it[Music]then the camera rings so they're a bitof a controversial design sure but likemost designs you kind of get used tolooking at it but you nevereverfully get it clean of dust so if you gocaseless like me not only does the phonesit kind of funny on a table but therewill also always be dust between thecamera rings so just get ready for thati would actually recommend if you get acase channel sponsor dbrand just droppedtheir atomic edition grip case and itdoesn't do a huge cutout all the wayaround the cameras like i thought wemight see in my impressions video itactually just matches the camera ringsand it looks way cleaner and it's justdeep enough to protect the cameras ifyou drop itso this is definitely the way to go youcan check it out at the link belowthen this phone just like the other s22sshoots 8k video at 24 fps you knowthe wrong frame rate give us the optionfor 30 samsung just put it in thesettings somewhere but even worse thannot having the 30fps toggle it actuallycrops inway more than the regular s22s so turnsout shooting 8k is 33 megapixels andit's actually cropping in to the middle33 megapixels of this huge 108 megapixelsensor so when you switch to 8k you zoomin to what feels like about 2x which ispretty inconvenient for framing no akvideo from the ultrawide or thetelephoto lenses this is a bit of adownside and then there is absolutelystill some shutter lag with this maincamera more than the regular s22s againand this is understandable with all theprocessing happening but it definitelyfelt like i was missing some shots orhaving trouble capturing moving objectsbecause of the bit of a delay betweenthe shutter press and the actual photobeing taken but speaking of cameraslet's just get the camera stuff out ofthe wayit's funny because this is probably whatmost people actually come to thesereview videos for if you think about itif you watch a smartphone presentationthese days75of a new phone presentation todayespecially a flagship is camera stuff sothat's one of the biggest things thatdifferentiates these phones and on a1200 phone it's one of the mostimportant featuresso how is it well you can see they wentwith basically the same layout of thisset of cameras as last year it's 108megapixel primary camera the ultra widethe 3x telephoto and the 10x telephotoplus laser autofocus and they're not thesame exact hardware as last year butthey're pretty close and that's a goodthing and samsung is not messing aroundwith their cameras these are definitelyflagship quality and i'm really happywith them matter of fact i don't evenhave much to say about image qualitybecause there really isn't much new herebut there are some new featureswithin the camera modes that might sortof unlock some new things and bedifferent about this phone so i'm gonnago over those with you one by one sofirst the more accurate portrait modenowi think i tweeted a couplemonths ago sort of ruffled some feathersbut i said something like samsung hasthe best like portrait mode onsmartphones right now andi understandably ruffled some feathersbut i should clarify basically what imean is their cutouts have been the mostconsistent and the most accurateof portrait modes among smartphones thati've seen so that doesn't mean the theblur is the most natural or the falloffis the most realistic i just mean theymake the least errors with like ears andhair and shirts and stuffand so this year they're planning onwell they've announced that they'redoing it even better they've got aistereo depth mapping for portrait modethat they claim can cut out things assmall as a single human hairwhich would be cool it's not exactlyaccurate but they say it's better so istill found it to be really good butit's definitely not perfect it stillmisses some stuff sometimes but i standby my statement these cutouts and depthmapping they're doing is really reallygood the portrait mode shots especiallylook good with the 3x lens with peoplewith pets even and also with inanimateobjects that still does a good jobcutting stuff out again not perfectyou'll pretty much always find someerror in every smartphone portrait modeshot but samsung does a really good jobi think the 1x portrait shots are goodto have but they don't look as naturalso i hope samsung works on thenaturalness and fall off of thebackground blur to overall make it thebest portrait mode then there is nightphotography which samsung has callednightographyokay so i compared the night mode shotsto the iphone 13 pro which also has anexcellent camera and my biggest takeawayis yes samsung's night mode photos aredefinitely more detailed 100but they're also dramatically brighteras advertised they're letting in a lotof light and the photos in the dark looklike you're taking them in a lot morelight than you actually have especiallylook at the sky back there so it'simpressive but it's also a bit of apreference thing some people want theirnighttime photos to look like they're atnight but then lastly there is an expertraw app separate from the camera appthat can take raw photos that includesmulti-frame computational photographydata hdr and everything and thedifferences are subtle but theyabsolutely do allow for more latitudewhen editing so photographers shoulddefinitely grab this app from theugliest app store i've seen in a whilethe samsung galaxy store so i'm going toend it with this you know typically thebig question with the review at the endof the review you're like well should ibuy it is it worth it and this is anexpensive phone it's 1200 bucks sothat's a big question so basically ithink their mission was accomplished thefact that they combined the note stuffwith this phonemakes it easier to separate from theregular s22s it makes it a moreobviously different phonein the lineup so if you just want like astandard really good flagship phone bigscreen nice battery nice cameras allthat stuff the s22 plusis a great phone and it's 200 less atthe starting pricebut if you want some specific extrathings like the super high resolutiondisplay or the s pen or some of thosecamera tweaksthen that gives you a reason to upgradeand it does deliver on those extrathings now that being said i am stickingwith the galaxy s21 ultra as my maindaily driver phone obviously people whohave this phone don't need to upgradebut it's just basically the same phoneas far as software battery cameras arealmost the same performance is the samebut uh with a design that i prefer and avibration motor that actually notifiesme more often but yeah overall thisphone is good it delivers if you want alittle bit of a more in-depth look atthe one ui 4.1 software and the factthat this phone at least this lineupwith the s22 for samsung seems to bebasically the default android experiencemore so than google's pixel ever couldbe definitely watch my s22 review i'llleave a like button if you want to watchthat real quick but that's beenbasically it thanks for watchingcatch you guys laterpeace
vax8FCuQUsE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,hey what's up mkbhd here and these aresamsung's new 2022 flagship smartphonesand i'm saying it's these and not theultra just because these will probablysell more volume and these are thephones more people will experienceand i do have some thoughts for my firsthands-on with them so the running themei think you'll notice here is uh if itain't broke don't fix itso they didn't they really did notchange a whole lot about these there's alot that's similar they played it safebut one of the biggest differences oneof the most noticeable differences to mewhen i actually got to hold it and feelit in the hand is something that mostpeople who buy it probably won't careabout that much because everyone puts acase on their phone and that's the buildquality so i have a video on the s22ultra dropping at the exact same time asthis one it'll be linked below if youwant to watch that it's basically agalaxy note but these phones are a smallupdate in every department from the s21series across the board and like i saidholding it in the hand for the firsttime the first thing i noticed is it's abit more boxy a little more square onthe sides a little more flat on the topand the bottom and just slightly tightercorner radii all the way around and thedisplay is already flat on the front soit just feels a bit sharper overall andthen on top of that the back is realglass this year instead of plastic likethe s21 again not a huge deal for mostpeople just putting a case on theirphone but that is a step up in myopinion from the s21 and the s21 fv andit adds a little bit of weight too it'ssome density some heft to the feel ofthe phoneeverything else on the outside thoughmostly the same design same centercamera cut out that i like so much samespeaker and button placement samefingerprint reader placement still ip68rated and at the front you're looking atessentially the same display as lastyear but slightly better and slightlysmaller so still two different sizes ofcourse the s22 plus is 6.6 inchesand this might sound weird to say butbecause of how small the bezels are thes22 at 6.1 inches feels kind of compactnow i'm doing air quotes like this isn'tthis clearly isn't a small phone but thenew boxer shape and just the way itfeels with the smaller bezels and thetighter corners it's it has a nicedensity to it just feels like a goodcompact sort of phone the update withthis display though is it is now a muchmore variable refresh rate than lastyear so instead of just being 60 or 120hertz this goes from 10 all the way upto 120 hertz now interestingly i'm toldfrom samsung it is still not ltpo that'sfor the s22 ultra only so we'll see ifthis new display is a more efficient ornot this is of course just the firstlook though it's not the full review sowe'll have to see if that pans out as iactually get to use the phone by the wayif you enjoy these quick first looksthese short first impressions videosthen there's a really good chance you'llenjoy this video's sponsor morning brewso of course i'm trying to keep you allup to date with these videos butmorningbrew is a free daily newsletterthat gets delivered right to your inboxthat keeps you up to speed on the techand finance and business world in aquick five-minute read so you'll forsure hear about new phones like thisgetting announced on morning brew butyou also hear about the company behindit and the dynamics of the competitionand all the other biggest stories in theindustry for sure and it's not thenormal like boring dry news languageit's actually pretty funny and witty andinformative at the same time so ifyou're interested in business finance ortech like i am it's completely free andit takes 15 seconds to subscribe you cango to morningbrew.com mkbhd and thenyou're in there so okay s22 and s22 plusare clearly pretty similar to the s21sfrom last year a little bit smaller andboxier but generally the same formfactors with a spec bump so the newspecs are a snapdragon 8 gen 1 or a new4 nanometer exynos chip in some regionsand all specs have eight gigs of ramwith either 128 or 256 gigs of storageagain that's it and then the new camerasare also a spec bump there's a newtriple camera layout 50 megapixel maincamera that's probably binning to 12 anda half megapixels then an ultra wide anda 3x telephoto camera the big change isthat the high resolution camera is themain camera not the telephoto so youmight remember last year when shooting8k video you had to crop into thetelephoto this time for shooting 8kvideo it can use the main camera whichis going to have that wider normal fieldof view smaller detail for some butthat's a big improvement for me then theother one thing to note is since thephones did get a bit smaller thebatteries also did get smaller from lastyear the plus goes from 4 800 to 4 500milliamp hours and the s22 goes from 4000 to 3 700 milliamp hours that'sreally interesting i mean the camerabumps aren't noticeably bigger i don'tknow if the glass is much thicker thanthe plastic used to be so i'm not reallysure of the reason but whatever it isyou know an eight percent smallerbattery something like that is somethingto keep an eye on for sure even if thedisplay is a bit more efficient we'llhave to test that but that's it as faras spec upgrades from last year like isaid not a super long list but if you'reinterested in these phones which youreally want to know is the differencebetween the s22 and s22 plus so here isthe entire official list first of allthey're different size phones so thesame resolution display 1080p but ofcourse a 6.6 inch larger one on the s22plus and then the plus supports a faster45 watt charging while the s22 onlysupports 25 watts no charger in the boxfor either of them but that's good toknow and the plus has ultra wide bandand wi-fi 6e support while the s22doesn't just has normal wi-fi 6 and thenlarger battery in the bigger phone 4 500milliamp hours over 3700 s22 plus999 s227.99 so yeah let me know what you wantto seein a full review of these phones once iactually get more than an hour to playwith them i think one ui 4.1 is one ofthe interesting things about this phoneobviously i saw there's a new messagesapp a default that appears to look justlike the google messages app i want tolook more into that but if you havequestions about the battery life thatcould be concerned the displays let meknow in the comments section i'll hangout there that'll inform the full reviewget subscribed to see it make sure youhit that red button if you haven'talready alright that's it thanks

6JaVs3h2mT8,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- The Samsung Galaxy S22 series is finally official.I've had some early hands on timeand this is everything you need to know.What's up guys, Saf here on SuperSaf TV,and let's break down all of the key differencesbetween these devices SuperSaf style.The first thing to noteis that we have three devices like we had last year.So there's an S22, an S22+ as well as an S22 Ultrawhich is the most notable device out of the three.Okay, sorry, I'm going to stop, I'm going to stop.The S22 Ultra has an S Pen.It has now been combined with the Note seriessomething which we've been anticipating for some timeand it's going to be included with the S22 Ultra.It's going to be enclosed within the devicelike we've had on previous Note devices.On the S21 Ultra, there was support for an S Penbut you'd have to buy that separatelywith a case or something.And this S Pen now has just 2.8 milliseconds of latencywhich is significantly lowercompared to what we had on at previous deviceswhich was around nine milliseconds.There's also a bunch of new featureswith the S Pen including handwriting recognitionfor up to 88 languages.Now, that's around 12 more than we had previouslyas well as collaboration view giving you seamless syncingwith something like the Tab S8so you can have controls on things on your S22 Ultrawhile you have the bigger canvas of the Tab S8.S Pen aside, the design of the devices is also different.The S22 and the S22+ do follow a similar design languageto what we had on the S21 seriesalthough it is a lot more flatter on the edges.And although the camera module is in a similar placeand has a similar design to the S21 series,it doesn't fully blend over like the S21 series did.The S22 Ultra, however, does look quite differentto the S21 Ultra.And the cameras are split upso they're not in a camera module as such.They're all individual.And we have much more of a boxier designlike we've had on the Note series in the past.Now, the good news is that all devicesare using premium materialsand they are the same across the board.So we've got Armor Aluminum FRAMeswith Gorilla Glass Victus+ on the front and back.Gorilla Glass Victus+ is around 12.5% more durablecompared to the previous generation.And we have a matte finishacross the board as well which I really do like.All devices have an IP68 water and dust resistance rating.And Samsung is also repurposed ocean based plasticsfrom fishing nets for some of the inner components.Size wise, the S22 is the smallestwith the S22+ increasing in sizeand the S22 Ultra being the heaviest and largest device.And with its more boxier edges,I would say that the S22 and the S22+are more comfortable to hold overall.But the S22 Ultra is the only one from the batch herethat has a curved display.So the edges do curve in whereas we've got flatter displayson the S22 and the S22+.And speaking of the displays,the displays are slightly and small compared to last year.We do have the Infinity-O design with small bezelsand a punch out.The S22 has a 6.1 inch display,a 6.6 inch display on the S22+.And the S22 Ultra has the largest 6.8 inch display.Now all devices have Dynamic AMOLED 2X technology.So we've got really nice colors, very deep blacks.But there are lots of key differences between the displays.And let me break them down for you.Firstly, the S22 and the S22+have a full HD plus resolutionwhereas the S22 Ultra does have a Quad HD+ resolution.So you're going to get sharper details on the S22 Ultra.And although all devices do supportthe maximum 120 Hertz refresh ratesfor very smooth scrolling and transitions and gaming.The S22 and the S22+ can go in 10 Hertz and 120 Hertzwhereas the S22 Ultra can go all the way down to one Hertz.This is going to make it a lot more efficient.So when you've got static things on the displayand you're not really scrolling around,it can go all the way down to one Hertzwhich is going to save on battery life.Now, there's also a differencein terms of the peak brightness.The S22 has a peak brightness of 1300 nitswhich is respectable and still very brightbut the S22+ and the S22 Ultracan go all the way up to 1,750 nits,making them some of the brightest displays out there.So Samsung is known for their displaysand the S22 series is no exception.We've got excellent displays across the boardbut the S22 Ultra is definitely the best.Now let's talk about the camerasbecause we do have new cameras across all of the devices.Sorry to interrupt side Saf here,I just had a really good idea.Okay.So you know how we're workingon the SuperSaf style camera comparison.I just thought if everybody watching subscribesand hits that bell iconthen they'll be able to see it as soon as it's live.You know what I mean?All right, you heard side Saf,if you want to see the SuperSaf style camera comparisons,they are in the worksand they will be coming live very soon.So be sure to subscribe and hit that bell iconso you don't miss them, right?The S22 and the S22+ have exactly the same cameras.We've got a 12 megapixel ultra wide,a new 50 megapixel primary cameraas well as a new 10 megapixel telephoto camera.The primary camera on the S22and the S22+ does have 23% larger pixels.And the new 10 megapixel three times optical zoom camerauses RAW-RGB dataso when zooming in,you should be getting up to four times better image quality.Now with the S22 Ultra, we also have some improvements.So there's a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera,a new 108 megapixel primary camerawith two telephoto cameras.One is going to give you three times optical zoomand the other is going to give you 10 times periscope zoom.There's also a laser auto focus sensor.Now the primary camera does have 1.23 times larger pixels.And there's also new adaptive pixel technologywhich will allow the cameras to capture 108and 12 megapixel images at the same timewhich allows for more detailed and brighter images.The portrait mode has also been improvedon the cameras with an AI stereo depth mapwhich should be able to even identify strandsof hair apparently.And I've only briefly tested this so farbut even in video it did look quite promising.And speaking of video, there are some improvements in video.Although the maximum resolution and fRAMe rateis still 8K at 24 fRAMes a second, that hasn't changed.You've got some new things like auto fRAMe rate.So this will drop the fRAMe rate depending on the lightand you're seem to be able to capture more.Personally speaking, for video,I like to keep a consistent fRAMe rateso I don't really want it to changedepending on what I'm shootingbut, hey, it's there.And there's also a new feature called auto fRAMingwhich will track subjectswithin five meters up to 10 people as well.And this seemed to work pretty wellbut I personally can't see myself using it too much.There's also an expert RAW modewhich will give you a more flexibility to edit in cameraand captures multi fRAMe RAW.And RAW format also worksacross all of the cameras this timeso that's really interesting.Once again, I'm going to emphasizethat I'm going to be doing a detailed SuperSaf stylecamera comparison of the S22 Ultra versus the competitionso do not forget to subscribebecause it's going to be juicy, right?What's powering the new S22 series.Well, like we've had in previous years,it is going to depend new region.So we do have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.And in other regions such as the UK,it will be the Exynos 2200.Now which one of these is going to perform better.I'm going to try to get in both devicesfrom both regions and do some more real world tests.And based on my experience, I'll be sharing that.So again, stay tuned for that.They should be both very capable devicesbut traditionally the Exynos falls behind the Qualcommbut we'll see how it is this year.In terms of RAM and storage, we have eight gigabytes of RAMon the S22 on the S22+available with either 128 or 256 gigabytes of storage.The S22 Ultra will have either eight or 12 gigabytes of RAMwith 128, 256, 512 and up to one terabyte of storage.Now that's a lot of storagebut as you may have already expectedthere is no expandable memory.We didn't have it on the S21 seriesand it's not here on the S22 series.You might notice that the RAM is lowercompared to what we had last year as well.However, it seems that because of the efficiencyof One UI 4.1 with the new chip sets,you should still be getting a decent RAM.And there's also a new feature called RAM+which will allow you to allocate some of the ROM as RAM.This is a trend that we're seeingon a few different devices this year.I'm not sure how well it's going to workbut it should give you that RAM boostif you need it for those more intensive tasks.Now for connectivity, the S22 just has Wi-Fi 6 and 5Gwhereas the S22+ and the S22 Ultrado have support for Wi-Fi 6Eas well as ultra wide band technology.Now, it really dependson how much you're going to be using this.Do you have a router with Wi-Fi 6Ebut that is an advantage that you geton the more premium models,the S22+ and the S22 Ultra.All devices have stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos.So you've got one speaker in the ear pieceand one bottom firing.Now for the batteries, so the S22 on the S22+actually have slightly smaller batteriescompared to what we had on the S21 and the S21+.However, it seems because of the more efficient chip sets,they should still will give you good battery life.This is something that I'm going to have to test out.The S22 Ultra does have the same size5,000 milliampere power batterylike we had on the S21 Ultrawhich in my experience did have overall good battery life.Now, all devices support 15 Watts of wireless chargingas well as reverse wireless chargingso you'll be able to charge other deviceson the back of these.However, when it comes to wire chargingthe S22 can only support up to 25 Wattswhereas the S22+ and the S22 Ultracan support up to 45 Watts.Now there's a catch because as expected,the chargers are not included out of the box.So you are going to have to buy these separately.A 25 Watt charger will set you back around 20 pounds or $20.A 45 Watt charger is going to be doubleor more than double that.So just something to keep in mind.Finally, pricing and availability.The good news is that the S22 serieswill be starting at roughly the same priceas the S21 series did last year based on your region.And if you are interested in picking up S22, the S22+or the S22 Ultra, then I will leave an affiliate link downin the description which will give you a bit of a discountand give you some optionsfor some really good trading offers.And that is the Samsung Galaxy S22 series.To answer the question that's in the title of this video,which should you buy?Well, if you are a Note fan,somebody that's liked the S Pen like I havethen it's a no brainer,the S22 Ultra is the flagship,the one that you will want to be going for.However, if you're somebody who's not really into the S Pen,then Samsung has opted the specs of the S22+and bought a few things in line with the Ultra series.So although the cameras are same as the S22,you are getting a higher peak brightness.You're getting the option of the faster charging.You're also getting things like Wi-Fi 6Eand ultra wide band supports.And if you do want to save some moneyand you want most of the boxes ticked offbut maybe you don't need those additional featuresand you want something that's a little bit more compactcompared to the S22+ and the S22 Ultrathen I do think that the S22 is a good option.Overall, I'm very excited for the S22 seriesespecially the S22 Ultra.What do you guys think of these?Do drop me a comment below.Let me know your thoughts.As mentioned earlier on,there's going to be a bunch of of coveragewith the S22 series here on the channel.If you don't want to miss any of itthen don't forget to subscribe and hit that bell icon.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did then do smash that like button for me.Thanks watching.This is Saf on SuperSaf TV and I'll see you next time."
k5tcHp1kBmQ,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- Just as I find myself approaching the endof the honeymoon period with my Galaxy Z Fold3where the flaws of the device begin to standout against the obvious advantages,Samsung has refreshed their S lineup with the S22 family.We've got two of them here today,the S22+ and the Note22 (coughs).Excuse me, the S22 Ultra,which is by all appearances a spiritual successorto Samsung's old Note lineupthat hasn't actually seen a new family membersince the Note20 Ultra 5G,which we've also got on hand today for comparison.So let's start of course with that.As something of a Note fanboy,if I was going to switch off of a foldable,I would probably end up with a Note.And from everything that I've seen so far,although that's very little,this appears to be a worthyand heavyweight successor to it.Wow!That is a flippin' heavy phone.Now one of the reasons, actually a couple of the reasons,that people on the interwebs are sayingthat they really feel like the S22 Ultrais less of an S and more of a Noteis that the industrial designcompared to the Note series is completely different.Instead of having a camera bump that is one large bumpwith multiple lenses embedded in it,the S22 Ultra has individual camera bumpswith their own accent rings about themthat I think looks absolutely fantastic.It's also less rounded off in the corners,which is less comfortable for sure in the palm.Like I can tell already holding the S22+that I'm gonna be less likely to get like a little divotburied into my palm here,though the edges are a little bit on the sharp side,compared to the S22 Ultra.But that gives them more internal space for,of course, the other big differencebetween the Note series and the S series traditionally,the embedded S Pen.Now I've seen some complaints about the relativelyboring design of the S Pen this time around.""Oh no, it's just matte blackcompared to some of the cool looking onesI've done in the past.""I'm gonna say as someone who used a Note for so longand absolutely loved the S Pen when I was using it,I don't care what it looks like.If I've got an S Pen,I'm absolutely gonna be doing things with it.It does everything from allowing you to take quick noteswhile the screen is still off,to using it as a camera shutterwhich I actually used more often than you might think,and on this particular camerais gonna be a whopping 40 megapixels.Oh, that's cute, I can already seetheir automatic fake bokeh being added here.Obviously not right now 'cause I'm recording a videoto mask that cut that we had to make there.But that's one of the areasthat the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC that's in the S22 seriesis dramatically faster than its predecessors.Image processing where it can handlesustained 720P, 960fps recording,among other things,as well as a significantly improvedmachine learning performance,where they are claiming that with their new AI-assistedfake bokeh mode, so let's find,oh, here we have a portrait mode,they can actually even handle like flyaways.So I don't know,do I have enough flyaways that we can try this on me?How am I looking here, ladies and gentlemen?I actually use this feature all the time.Because even if you're not using a Fold,which conveniently does allow youto preview your selfie pictures on the main camerawith the outside screen,as long as you can kind of aim at yourself,you can get way better selfies on a rear proper camerathan you will even with a 40 megapixel front camera,going through that tiny, little hole there.It's definitely losing some of the detailin some of those little wispy hairs, but not bad.Look at that, it even got the neck hairs.Other main benefits of the stylus are the abilityto pop up this little menu to quickly create gifs,or get screenshots, or write on screen capturesso that you can jot notes down and send them off to people.These are things that I have really missed about the Noteand could actually tempt me to return it.Another cool thing about the S Pen this time aroundis apparently the latency, even compared to the last gen,has been dramatically reduced using a combination of AIand then technology that they've integrated from Wacom.- Way-kaam.- [Linus] So I'm gonna go ahead and I don't know, whatever.Let's just write on the screen.- [Brandon] Is that a sound effect?- Yeah, it's like a screechy.- [Jono] Oh wait, that's from the speaker?- Yeah, it's cheesy, but I don't mind it.In terms of the feel,I wouldn't say that it's markedly differentfrom my I experience with previous S Pens.But in terms of the latency, wow.It feels less like writing with a stylusand more like just drawing on your screen.Like that's pretty cool.Back to the cameras for a second.On the Ultra version, we've got a total of five lenses here,including a main shooterthat's 108 megapixels this time around,a 12 megapixel ultra-wide, 10 megapixel telephoto,another 10 megapixel telephotowith a 10 times optical zoom,as well as a depth sensor.On the 22 and 22+ versions of the phone,you get a 50 megapixel main shooter,along with 12 megapixel ultra-wideand 10 megapixel telephoto,but just the one telephoto lens.And both of those, at least spec wise, are the same.This video is brought to you by the dbrand Grip.That's right, that's how you pronounce it.I've been saying it wrong for years.I thought it was D-brand,but it's pretty clear that I was an idiot,because right there there's no space, there's no dash.In fact, the D and the B are even joined together.It's dbrand, so if you ever hear them saying it wrongon their official channel, which was how I got confused,you can let them know that they really need to do betterand they'll probably send you backa really nice, politely worded message.I've been asked by dbrand to show offtheir Atomic Grip case, which is thinner than ever,while still having their nice grippy sides.Wow, on a phone this big,you kind of need it to be thinner than ever.As well as their shock protection,and, of course, nice, big clearancesfor all the things you're gonna need access to.And other than that, I mean,there's not too much to say about it.Other than that it's a nice caseand it's almost perfectly flushwith the camera cutouts on the back.I don't believe it's actually for sale yet,but it should be very soon.Thanks, dbrand, for sponsoring this video.Remember, if it's not dbrand, then you ain't d'man.Now in terms of the other specs,where I really wanna start is the display.Samsung it's no secret producesthe best mobile phone displays in the worldby basically any way of measuring themand they have, once again, one upped themselves.Apparently reaching 1,750 nitspeak brightness,but you only get that on the S22+as well as the S22 Ultra, not on the regular S22.Of course, I'm gonna wanna seewhat HDR content looks like on here.Frankly, I'm not even expecting to be able to benefitfrom that kind of peak brightnesson just regular HDR10 content on YouTube.But it's interesting, Samsung is calling outthat part of their performance outdoors with the S22 seriesis AI enhancement of color, or something like that,to make it more readable.But I had actually noticed a similar thingwhere it's not just that the display brightness amps up,but also that the color profile changes,even on my old Note9.So I don't really know what the deal is with that.Maybe if you guys know anything about it,you could give me some clarity in the comments.As usual, a new generation of phones comes outand it is almost without a doubtgoing to be the best display in your house.Man, there's a big differencebetween HDR and HDR.In terms of other specs, I already mentionedthat it's using a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor,but what exactly does that mean?What it means, Android friends,is that we are still a couple of generations behind Applein terms of raw performance.But, in the real world, it means that we're getting anywherefrom a five to 20% uplift in raw performanceover last generation's Snapdragon 888,depending on what kind of metrics you're looking at.A huge boost in machine learning performanceand a massive generational increase in gaming performance.To the point where for games, the S22 Ultra,assuming that it has no cooling issues,which of course we haven't tested yetI just opened the boxes,should be competitive with the iPhone 13 lineupin terms of games.One spec change that's causing some controversyis Samsung's decision to downgradethe 128 gig version of the S22 Ultrafrom 12 gigs on the S21 Ultra to just eight gigs.You will get 12 gigs on the 256, 512,and one terabyte versions.But on the base model,you actually get less RAM than last generation.On the S22 and S22+ you don't have to worry about that'cause you're gonna get eight gigs regardless.And they're only available in 128 gigand 256 gig configurations.One thing that's not looking as promisingis Samsung's charging technology this time around.We get a 3,700, 4,500 and 5,000 milliamp hour battery,depending on whether you go for the S22, Plus, or Ultra.But the charging rates are, while good for Samsung,not that good compared to particularlysome of their Chinese competitors.And it's limited to 25 watts on the base modeland 45 watts on the higher-end ones.Personally, I don't consider this to be a major issuebecause I almost never fast charge my phone.It's just it might not kill your battery immediately,but it sure as heck isn't good for it.But if you're the kind of person who wantsto be able to juice your phone up quickly,then you're gonna have to settle for what is it?They quote 50% in 20 minutes or something like that?Hopefully, you can get by with half of your chargein the time it takes you to have a showerand get ready to go out.You know what I wanna come backto now though is the display.On the S22 and S22+ you get same 120 Hertz refresh rate,as well as 240 Hertz touch sampling in game mode,so that's gonna be up therewith the decent gaming phones on the market,and the same 10 to 120 Hertz refresh window.But on the Ultra, I'm actually expecting,that even though its display is significantly larger,it's 6.8 freaking inches this time around,you could be getting significant energy efficiency savingsfrom the fact that they've gone all the way from 10 Hertzdown to just one refresh per second, one Hertz.Is it still a Hertz or is it a Hertwhen you have just one of them?One refresh per second on the displaywhen you're looking at static content.That is a pretty impressive feat.Running through some other key specs,we've got ultrasonic fingerprint sensorsacross the entire lineup.We've got wireless chargingat 15 watts across the entire lineup,and Android 12 with Samsung's One UI 4.1that includes some cool features,including a newer improved walletthat'll store more than just payment cards,as well as a new privacy dashboardthat I actually wanna have a look at here,that's designed to prevent any unauthorized appsfrom getting access to anythingthat you don't want them to have.Alert when the clipboard's accessed, that's super cool.Get alerts when they have camera access.That is a weird little jelly effect when you,can't say I'm a big fan.Shoot, there was something that I had wantedto check out in here.Oh right, I remember, I wanted to seehow their ultrasonic fingerprint sensor'sdoing in terms of speed these days.It's okay.Apparently, they've done a lot to improve stabilization,and honestly I can see it.Holy crap, are you gonna get a close upof me kind of shaking this camera around?Okay, because you are gonna be really impressedwhen the editor puts that video in the cornerwhile this video that I'm recordingis playing on the main screen.That's pretty cool.Damsung, instead of Samsung, get it?Damsung, son, Damsung, oh, it doesn't matter.There's still no SD card slot, which blows.I'm still not over it.I'm over the headphone jack,but I'm not over the SD card slot.I don't think I ever mentioned that the selfie cameraon the non-Ultra models is just 10 megapixels,instead of 40 megapixels.I'm not expecting it to honestlymake an enormous difference,'cause you're more limited by just how much lightyou can get through that tiny, little hole.Oh, I lied.Yeah, it's sharper.See there's enough resolutionto pick up my nose hairs on the Ultra.Whereas, they just kind of fade away.This is where higher resolutionsare just really not doing us any favors sometimes.You know what I'm saying?Leaving only one thing remaining, price.They're fricking expensive,with the S22 Ultra starting at $1,200 in the US.And for 128 gigs of storage with no expansion options,that is a really tough pill to swallow.But it certainly appears to be the entire packagein every other way.So if you're looking for a flagship Android device,I mean, recently Yvonne needed an upgradeand I tried giving her anything other than a Samsung,and she was just like, ""Yeah, this is not doing it for me.""OnePlus has really slipped up on hardware,or excuse me, software.So she wants to go back to Samsung,who ironically used to be notablefor their terrible software experience, pun intended.Get it, it's a notable phone?You know what? It doesn't matter.The point is subscribe to ShortCircuit.Banana for today is for scale, buy one, lttstore.com.We also have hoodies.- And tuques. - And tuques.And lanyards."
RAn-FIpun24,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"When the Galaxy S22 was announced,many were cautious since its battery capacity was smaller.The overall specs was also rather complicated since it'sdetached from the Galaxy S22+ and of course the Galaxy S22 Ultra.For me personally, I want to leave all of those specsand comparisons aside and only focus on the Galaxy S22 alone.I don't even get to test out the Galaxy S21 from last year,so I'm literally going into this phone blind.And throughout my week with the Galaxy S22,I found out a lot of interesting points about this phone.So let me share my experience with you.So let's start off with the usual - design.It's using the same designas the Galaxy S21 series, and I still think it's a very nice design.Overall, it has a matte finish and also that distinctive camera cutout,and yet it is now available in the multiple of different colors.What I did realize, though, is that this green color on the GalaxyS22 is much darker than what I remembered when I saw the Galaxy S22Ultra during the briefing.So that might be dueto the lighting condition, but yeah, it appears a lot darker now.This Galaxy S22 is also tiny but not in the ways that I expected.So you see, this phone is what I would describe to be stubby.Since it is short and rather wide at the same time.But that is alsobecause I've been using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for the past six months or so.So my perspective might be a little bit warpedeither way, combined with its sharp edges it does dig into the palm of my handa little bit, but that's not really a big deal.What is a big deal, though, is the sharpnessof the camera bump where the ends meet As you can see here,yeah, this this corners here are very sharp,and if I place the phone on the table and drag it across the tableat a certain angle, I'm pretty sure this wooden table will get scratched.But the cameras themselves within the Galaxy S22 do will also tweaked.We still havea total of three different cameras and they all take fantastic photos.Again, this is one of those phones that I don't have to worry when it comesto snapping a picture.And of course, the Galaxy S22 doesn't have laser autofocus, so the focusing timeisn't the fastest or the most accurate, but it works most of the time.Taking ultrawide shots like this sceneryshot right here is also fine, and they do look good.However, the ultra wide angle camera doesn't have autofocus,which was a surprise to me since it doesn't have autofocus.The Galaxy S22 cannot take macro shots using the focusenhancer mode *just like* the Ultra variants of their phones.This is not a big deal since I personally also turn off the focusenhancer feature on the Galaxy S21 Ultra because I would much rather preferjust to use the telephoto camera, zoom in and take a shot.And speaking of the telephoto camera, it can take some good shotseven up to 30 times zoom. For night shots.They all do look good as well, so no complaints here.And as a bonus, Samsung also has updated the Expert RAW appto support the Galaxy S22 to and that means we can take some fantasticlooking pictures with this compact phone right here.But we will leave that for another topic.And I can assure you a video about Expert RAW is coming soon.I've also tested night mode *video*.And in terms of stability, it's not really the best since it'sa lot more jittery and hence creating even more stabilization artifacts.But the video quality in itself is actually pretty goodsince the noise level is very low.As for the screen's this is also something very interestingbecause this phone comes with a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X displaywith up to 120Hz refresh rate and the usual resolution of 2400 by 1080.Everything looks magnificent to my eyes and I'm really happy with this screen.It also has thin bezels all around the screen,and since my eyes couldn't see anything wrong with this screen,I decided to whip out our colorimeter to test it up.What I found here is also very interesting By default,its maximum manual brightness is up to about 460 nitsThe white point isn't the best, but I would consider it to be good enoughand then I headed into the settings menu and found out that the Galaxy S22also has the option to turn on Extra Brightness.So once I turn that on, it can reach up to 750 nits of brightness.And the white point is also sent that this level of brightnessis similar to what we found on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.So review about that at the top right corner there.We also tested the color accuracy both at 100 nits of brightnessand also at its absolute maximum of 775 nits of brightness.The color gamut coverageresults of both brightness (brightnesses?) were very similar.However, the Delta E number did change quite a lot And when it comesto the performance, this is something that I'm not going to focus much.It still uses the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipsetand it performs well enough with my day to the use.I'm not even going to touch about gaming since this phone righthere has a pretty small screen and my hands will take upmost of the screen space and the performance coming out of itis going to be similar to the S22 Ultra anyway,since these two phones are thermally throttled.However, I did spend a lot of time with the Galaxy S22as my secondary phone in my pocket, and I usually open a lot of apps at once.And surprisingly, that 8GB of RAM handled everything just fine.And of coursethe battery life is my biggest concern when it comes to the Galaxy S22.And just like what we did with the Galaxy S22 Ultra,we calibrated it to 100 nits of brightness and we ran PCMark 10 batterylife tests and we got nine and a half hours through that.That is not a bad number for such a small phone.Remember the Galaxy S22 has its batterycapacity shrunk from the Galaxy S21.And to put things in perspective, I managed to make this phone lastas long as the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is my daily driver, and throughthat I found out that the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 is indeed more efficient than the Snapdragon 888.But yeah, it just doesn't heat up that much when I'm using it.Still, the efficiency is not as good as the Exynos 2100.As for the charging time, though, the Galaxy S22 remains at 25 watts maxand we plugged it into our Ugreen 100W GaN charger and it took about 95 minutes,which is an hour and a half to charge from 15 to 100%.It's definitely not the fastest in terms of fast charging,but I'm okay with it since I charge my devices overnight anyway.As for the software, it's pretty much the same as the Galaxy S22Ultra, so I won't touch on this that much.As a quick recap,it runs on One UI 4.1 and it comes with Android 12 out of the box.And this phone is also part of the new update policy too.So what Samsung promised for this phone is also four generationsof Android OS upgrades and five years of security patches,which I think is fantastic.And so for the starting price of RM3,499.I think this is still a fantastic compact phone.Remember, small phones do come with the limitationof space, hence some trade offs need to be done.I'm definitely not happy with the shrunken battery when compared to the S21,but the overall package I was to say this is still a fantastic phone.However, if you are seeking for a larger phone, thenI might avert your eyes from the Galaxy S22+ to the S21 FE instead.Because if we look back the phone comes with a lower price, although it usesa previous generation of chipset, which is the Exynos 2100 here in Malaysia.And I don't really mind because that chipset is much more efficientand the only trade off you'll be getting is the not so goodcamera on the Galaxy S21 FE when compared to the S22+.Still with such a big price gap, it's up to youwhether or not you want to spend that much to get the S22+ or the S21 FE.So, yeah, that's it.That's all we have to share with you about this phone.Still nice and compact, and if you have any questions, leave them down.The comments section below We see you guys in the next video."

YiOdsiheCw8,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,last week we covered the new galaxy s22ultra which is really a note by anothername there's a built-in s pen boxierdesign yada yada and people are prettyexcited about it but today i want tocover samsung's other new phones the s22plus and s22 which at first glance are alittle more boring by most indicationslast year's galaxy s21 and s21 plus fellshort of samsung's sales goals they justdidn't do enough to stand out from avery crowded android pack not to mentionsamsung's many other phones and thecompany cheaped out on the regular s21by using plastic on the back instead ofglassso with the new lineup samsung wastrying to write some of those wrongs andre-establish the s22 as the go-toreliable flagship and well yeah i'dagree that now is a pretty good

ought to bejust as fastfor a thousand dollars the plus modelhas most features you'd want full 5gsupport wi-fi 6e ultra wide band speedy45 watt wire charging and so on now likei said earlier samsung's new phonesmight initially feel a bit boring butthe quality and fit and finish is therelike always samsung's oled screens arealways just that much nicer than what'son a pixel god knows the fingerprintsensor is a lot better the s22 plus ands22 have corning's gorilla glass victisplus on both front and back they're thefirst phones to have that and they'reusing samsung's more rugged armoraluminum with an ip68 dust and waterresistance rating as for softwaresamsung just committed to four years ofmajor android updates for all of itsrecent phones at the time of this videothat's a longer guarantee than googleitself can give you meanwhile one ui hasgotten to a very good reliable placesure you still deal with some bloatwareand doubled up apps from samsung andgoogle but the list of features is longand since these phones come with android12 you get greater control over yourcamera and mic privacy settings there'salso a new samsung wallet app thatcombines samsung pay with driverslicenses and even cryptocurrency so youcan tell by now that i'm pretty high onthe s22 plus do i wish the display washigher resolutionmaybe would it be nice if it had thesame cameras as the ultra definitely buti can't point to any one glaringweakness of this phone that optimismstarts to fade with the regular s22which has a 6.1 inch screen and itreally comes down to pricemuch of the hardware of idles 120 hertzscreen processor ram camera system areidentical between the two and samsung'smercifully gotten rid of the s21'splastic back and gone back to glass butas usual the small phone gets shortchanged with a smaller battery 3 700milliamp hours and slower 25 wattcharging speeds samsung even drops thepeak brightness and ditches ultrawideband from the standard 22 so youwon't get the same precision when you'retracking down lost itemsit's a lot of sacrifice and settlingwhen you consider that the s22 costs7.99that's when there's a better argumentfor competitors from google of oneplusand everybody elsei'd sooner buy samsung's own s21 fe andits bigger battery for 6.99 and livewith the plastic backboth new s22 models go on sale february25th there's an easier case to be madefor the plus size than the regular but ihave no idea if they're going to provemore popular than last year again theylook and feel samey to what came beforewhat i do know is there's something tobe

ohlVy2jYTjY,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"This is Samsung’s ultimate flagship- the Galaxy  S22 ultra, and unlike the rest of this year’s  S series, it brings a design and features  which are more like a Galaxy Note phone.The most obvious of these is the improved stylus  support, but there’s a lot more to this phone than that.I’m Will for GSMArena and let’s see what  the S22 Ultra has to offer in our full review.The galaxy S22 ultra brings a design that’s quite  different from the rest of the S series.It’s larger and heftier, and its cameras come straight  out of the back, rather than being mounted in a camera bump.Plus the ultra has a flat back,  top and bottom, quite like a galaxy Note device.Another big change over last  year’s model is that the S22 ultra  integrates the stylus into the design,  with a dedicated dock at the bottom.It’s a lot more secure, and it means  you always have your pen with you-  unlike the S21 Ultra where  you’d need to keep it elsewhere.Don’t worry about the dock- the phone  has full ip68 rated ingress protection.  Plus it’s overall quite durable with gorilla  glass victus plus on the back and the front.As you can see, the S22 ultra is a lot less like  a Galaxy S phone and more like a Galaxy Note-  and since that lineup is discontinued  now, this is the spiritual successor. And while the stylus is the same  as saw in the last generation,  the tech supporting it has been upgraded here. The S22 ultra’s AI can even better anticipate  your movements, reducing the latency of  the pen from 9 milliseconds to less than 3. So taking notes is a bit more responsive. And the  function for converting your handwriting into text  has been improved to be even more accurate.Adding media to your notes is nothing new.But now, you can add a snapshot of  a whole webpage, if you want to.The function doesn’t work  that well in Europe though,  since websites need to ask for permissions- and  these sorts of popups end up in your notes too. Alright let’s move on to some other  features- like the display itself.  It’s a 6.8 inch AMOLED with a QHD  resolution and a fast 120Hz refresh rate. This display is curved at the edges,  wrapping around to meet the frame.  It creates a neat effect, but some people would  prefer a flat screen like on the other S22 phones. The 120hz refresh rate means that swiping and  scrolling on screen looks much smoother.The refresh rate is adaptive - with static content,  the UI rendering can go as low as 24Hz and as low  as 1fps to save energy, and it will also  adjust to match other content on screen.The display is awesome. With its high resolution,  content looks quite sharp, and you also get great  contrast and deep blacks thanks to the  OLED tech. There’s HDR 10 plus support,  and colors can be super accurate, depending  on the profile you choose in color settings.The S22 ultra also has class leading max  brightness. With the manual slider, you  can achieve 500 nits, and that boosts up to around  830 nits if you enable the extra brightness mode.But that’s not all. Enabling auto  brightness mode gets you an even  bigger boost- we measured a maximum over  12 hundred and 50 nits- pretty crazy stuff.In addition to that, when auto brightness  mode is on, a new feature called vision  booster will also adjust the contrast  of the screen based on ambient light,  to make legibility out in the sun even better. And under the screen sits an ultrasonic  fingerprint reader. It’s quite fast and  responsive to wake up and unlock the phone. For audio, the S22 ultra has a pair of stereo  speakers, with the earpiece acting as the  second one. The speakers earned a score  of good on our loudness charts, but are a  bit quieter than last year’s model, and we’ve  also heard better low end in the competition. Storage isn’t expandable here via microSD,  but you can opt for up to a terabyte  of space onboard, if you need it! The interface of the S22 ultra is Samsung’s  OneUI 4.1, based on android 12. Besides the  features that are based on the stylus, it’s  the same UI you’d get on the S22 and S22 plus. Of course, one important aspect to keep  in mind is Samsung software support.  They promise 4 generations of Android and  OneUI updates, and 5 years of security updates. The interface also brings a few new features, like  additional functionality and support for widgets. Android 12 allows you to change  the color of your system menus and  even your icons to match your wallpaper.And there’s a dedicated privacy dashboard, which organizes all of your privacyand permissions options into one easy to reach spot.Under the hood of the S22 ultra is either  an Exynos 2200 chipset, for some markets,  or a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, for others. Both  are based on a 4nm process, and are comparable,  but the Exynos variant has a GPU that  was designed in collaboration with AMD. We have an Exynos model, and performance  here is great, as you’d expect  from a high end flagship. It’s more than enough  to multitask and play heavy games without a hitch.  Plus the thermal management is quite reasonable  here. Of course the previous generation is tough  to beat, and in benchmarks the improvements  compared to the S21 ultra are modest. Powering the S22 ultra is a 5000mAh battery,  like last year’s model, but battery life scores  are a little less this time around, with an  endurance rating of 108 hours in our tests.  Still that’s not too shabby. Charging is a bit complicated though.  The S22 ultra supports up to 45 watt fast  charging, but when using such an adapter  we weren’t able to charge the phone  meaningfully faster than with a 25 watt one. There will be a new 45W charger coming from  Samsung, but based on the specs and info so far,  we don’t expect charging speed  will be any different with it.Now we have the cameras: a 108MP main cam, a  10MP telephoto with OIS and 3x optical zoom,  a 10MP periscope with 10x optical  zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide.The setup is almost exactly  the same as last year's,  except that the telephoto cameras have different  sensors with smaller pixels, for some reason. Anyway, let’s start off with photo quality from  the main cam. Its 12MP shots are good, but don’t  blow us away. There’s plenty of detail, accurate  exposure and lively colors.and the dynamic  range isn’t as wide as we expect from a flagship. The ultrawide cam delivers sharp and detailed  images which have wide dynamic range.  There does seem to be some  graininess and extra sharpening here. At 3 times zoom, we see a good level  of detail, wide enough dynamic range,  and colors that match the other cameras well.  And actually, these zoomed shots are pretty  noise free- cleaner than last year’s even. Portrait mode on the S22 ultra delivers  great results. You can shoot portraits with  either the main or the 3 times telephoto,  and you get excellent subject separation as well  as a very natural looking defocused background. Photos from the 10 times telephoto  have respectable detail levels,  and good contrast and colors. If you’re shooting in auto mode in low light,  the S22 ultra will automatically apply night  mode processing. These photos from the main  cam are impressive, with an excellent level  of detail and well preserved colors. You also get  nicely contained highlights and developed shadows. You can also toggle a dedicated night mode,  which dials up this processing even furtherThe result  is that lighting looks brighter and warmer,and  there’s heavier sharpening and reduced noise.The effect on dynamic range is pretty minimal.The ultrawide cam will also use the auto night mode in dark situations,and these shots  are pretty good. They have very good detail,wide dynamic range, and lively colors.  There is some visible noise though.Turning on the full night  mode cleans up that noise,  and it brightens up and restores  the detail in the shadows. Shooting with the 3 times telephoto with  the auto night mode applied will produce  decent images, but they are on the soft side. Here toggling the full night mode is well  worth it. The picture is significantly  sharper, and shadows get a nice boost. At 10 times zoom, with auto night  mode on the photos look okay,  but are soft and have some patches of noise. The dedicated night mode makes a big difference,  improving the sharpness, the noise  levels, and detail in the shadows. Selfies are taken with a 40MP front  facing cam, but come out in 10MP.  These are superb, with plenty of detail,  accurate colors, and wide dynamic range.  Plus the camera has autofocus, so  your selfies will come out sharp. The S22 ultra can record video in up  to 4K at 60fps with all of its cameras,  as well as 8K at 24fps with the main one. Starting off with 4K video from the main cam,  you see a very good amount of detail,  accurate colors and excellent dynamic range. 8K looks good on a specs sheet, but there isn’t  noticeably more detail here than with the 4K  footage. Plus it’s softer, with some visible  artifacts, and the clips take up a lot more space. 4K video from the ultrawide cam is  detailed, with wide dynamic range.  The colors are a bit warmer than  those you get from the main cam. 3 times zoomed footage is sharped and detailed,  with excellent dynamic range and spot on colors.  There is some visible noise here though. 4K video quality from the 10 times telephoto  isn’t mind blowing, but it is respectable,  especially for this sort of camera. There’s electronic stabilization available  on all of the cameras and resolutions,  and it does a decent job, though we did  notice some overcorrection when panning.There’s also a super steady mode which smooths  things out even further, but only in 1080p. At night, the S22 ultra can record  relatively good videos, with  its main camThe detail here is better than last year’s model. Colors are well preserved too.  The dynamic range isn’t the widest though,  with both clipped highlights and dark shadows. The ultrawide doesn’t do as well, and its  videos come out underexposed and soft. In a similar fashion, the telephoto  cameras struggle at night.  The 3 times zoomed clips are more  usable than the 10 times ones though. So, that’s the Galaxy S22 Ultra. After Samsung  skipped releasing a Note phone last year,  and then discontinued the Notes altogether,  this is what they’ve come up with.  It brings the latest flagship features, likethe cutting edge AMOLED display and top notch chipset,plus the killer cameras, but on top of that there’s the extra responsive and dockable stylus.So at the end of the day, if you’re  looking for the features and form  factor of a Galaxy Note phone, in a new  device with the latest software support,  the S22 ultra is worth recommending. Thanks  for watching and see you on the next one."

yCmHaQHnVSk,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,this is a samsung galaxy s22 notei mean ultra the samsung galaxy s22ultrabut it's also kind of the galaxy s22noteit's big it's loaded with cameras and itcomes with a stylus built insounds like a note right that's becausesamsung has merged the note in the sseries phones making the s22 ultra moreor less the new notethat move gives the ultra a distinctidentity in the s22 seriesmore so than last year's s21 ultrathis isn't just a big phone withflagship specs it's a big phone withflagship specs a stylus built in and ahandful of other unique features andthey won't appeal to everyone but theyturn the ultra into something very extrado people still say extra[Music]without even turning the phone on it'sobvious from the design that the s22ultra has an identity separate from thes22 it has a boxier shape which itinherited directly from the note seriesand there's a curved rather than flatdisplay as for the camera bump wellthere isn't one the ultra's rear cameralenses are just there protruding fromthe back of the phone it's a departurefrom the s22 and s22 plus design andonce i got used to the idea of a phonewith no camera bump i have to admit ikind of like it the spaces betweenlenses tend to trap a little bit of dustand light so you might need to get inthere occasionally with a cleaning clothbut who knows maybe 2022 is the yearthat we leave the camera bump behindonce and for allprobably notof course the s22 ultra shares plenty oftop tier specs with its fellow s22flagshipsit has the same snapdragon 8 gen 1processor ip68 weatherproofing and thelatest gorilla glass victus plus on thefront and back it looks and feels everybit the 1200 flagship that it isperformance is excellent switchingbetween apps is quick and animationslook buttery smooth on that big 6.8 inch120 hertz oled displaywhat doesn't feel quite flagship like isthe ultra's battery lifethe phone includes a big 5 000 milliampbattery which it absolutely needs thedownside to using a first generationchipset and a huge bright display isthat it makes the s22 a very powerhungry device i got through a day oflighter use with plenty of power tospare but it doesn't take a lot ofeffort to push the battery below 20 bythe end of the day if you're a poweruser you'll need to keep an eye on yourbattery percentage and that kind ofsucks on a flagship phone[Music]but let's get back to the star of theshow this stylus or s pen as samsungcalls itjust like with the note series it popsout of a dedicated silo built into thebottom of the phone when the phone isunlocked this brings up a menu of styluscentric options to do things like starta new note or take a screen grab andwrite on the image samsung says the spen is more responsive this year with 70lower latency it's tough to judge theaccuracy of that claim it's measured inmilliseconds but writing with the s penfeels fluid and natural one of theultra's tricks is identifyinghandwriting and converting it to textwhich is now supported in a dozen morelanguages and it's surprisingly good attranslating my awful scribbles intohuman readable textoutside of these improvements there'snot much that's new about the s pen orthe stylus features that the ultrasupports if you're new to the stylistlife it can take a minute to getcomfortable with all of its features youcan also dial in settings to your likingsuch as how long it waits after you'vestopped writing to convert your textit's a powerful set of features once youget the hang of it especially if you'vebeen hanging on to an aging note 9 or 10but be prepared to spend some timegetting a feel for things if you're newto the s pennow let's talk camerasthese aren't exactly the same sensorsand lenses as the s21 ultra but thedifferences are minor samsung is toutingbig improvements mainly when shooting inportrait mode in low lightthe company says that subject detectionis now more precise in portrait mode andthat low light imagery is more detailedthanks to ai improvementsand you know what it's actually madegood on these promisesthe differences are subtle but they'remostly good and occasionally great let'slook at portrait mode first samsung saysthat its depth mapping can now identifydetails as small as individual hairs onyour subject precisely identifyingsubjects and separating them from thebackground remains a tricky feat forsmartphones and it's one of the ways youcan usually tell a smartphone portraitfrom one taken with a larger camerasamsung hasn't perfected this quite yetif you look close at this one you cansee where it gets tripped up around thesubject's beard but overall theportraits i've taken with the s22 ultraare some of the best most convincingimages i've seen from a phone so farthe phone really does handle finedetail-like hair better both on humansand pets which are now officiallysupported portrait subjects by the wayportrait mode images from the standardwide camera still look artificialthey're just trickier to pull off butphotos from the three times telephoto ingood lighting look great the transitionbetween sharp and blurred parts of theimage is smooth and it isolatesindividual strands of my hair ratherthan just smoothing them over andcalling it a daynext up that ten times optical zoom it'snot new the s21 ultra had one too butit's still much more reached than thetypical three times and four timestelephoto cameras on other flagships andsomething you'll only get on the ultramodel not on the standard s phones asfar as telephoto lenses on smartphonesgo it's not bad it's stabilized which isa huge help keeping your shot steady youcan go beyond 10 times up to 30 and even100 times digital zoom but image qualitygoes downhill real fast the farther yougo out you don't have to look too hardto see where it comes up short versus atraditional camera with the zoom lensbut photos at 10 times and even 30 timeszoom in good light are definitelypassable for social mediayou won't always have good lighting towork with so that's where samsung'snight imagery improvements come insamsung is trying to call thisknightography but let's just stick withknight photographynow you can capture full 108 megapixelimages with night modepreviously you could either use one orthe other but not both at the same timethe results in extremely low light areimpressivenight mode doesn't make much of adifference in dim lighting but in neardarkness high-res photos look much lessnoisy with better coloroverall though low light photography isstill a little hit or miss in terms ofquality especially if you'rephotographing a moving subject like aninfant you can take a portrait modenight selfie now in really darkconditions which seems impressive butthe results are not greathigh res night mode has some interestingapplications for landscape photographersbut these aren't features i would usevery often and i suspect most peoplewouldn't eithersamsung hasn't exactly revolutionizednight photography here just slightlyimproved itthe ultra also supports a new camera appcalled expert rawnow this gets a little complicated whileyou can still take a regular singleframe raw image with the native cameraapp the expert raw app captures datafrom multiple frames and combines theminto one raw filethe resulting image has less noise thana single frame rawand like traditional raw images can bemanipulated in photo editing softwarethere is a shortcut to edit directly onyour phone with samsung's lightray mapbut you can easily export the photos toedit them on the software of your choiceit's not something i'd use all the timebut it is more useful than a traditionalsingle frame raw file from a smartphonethe s22 ultra ships with one ui 4.1which is samsung's take on android 12.it introduces new customization optionslike the ability to change thesystem-wide color palette to match yourwallpaperyou can apply this change to things likecontrol panel buttons and opt to expandit to app icons i find that kind ofjarring so i stuck with the systemcontrols and the effect is nice asintended it does actually make the phonefeel a little more me sojob well done google and samsung the s22ultra is a really good phone that livesup to its name by piling on the extraslike the s-pen a decent 10-time zoom andsome new low-light photography optionsthese are all decidedly niche featuresso if one or more of those really appealto you then you'll be very happy withthe ultra because there's just no otherdevice that does all of those things butif you're just mildly curious about thezoom lens or the stylus you'd probablybe better off saving a couple hundredbucks and going with the s22 plus2022 may not actually be the year thatthe camera bump disappearsit's definitely not the year of thenight photography revolution but it isthe year that samsung established theultra model of its mainstream s seriesas something differentit's no longer just the bigger beefierspec model of a trio flagship phonesit has a few distinct offerings that addup to a device unlike anything else onthe marketultra indeed hey thanks for watching i'mat home recording this on the ultra'sbuilt-in selfie camera and microphoneit's not exactly night photography butlet me know what you think about theimage quality in the comments
c96Y-QlNtUU,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"Samsung's Galaxy S Series phones have for many years been easy to recommend, but lately,many Chinese smartphone brands have been trying their hand in the premium smartphone market.  OnePlus jumped into the premium space with its past couple of flagship launches, along with Xiaomi and Vivo.All these brands now offer highly competitive products that match or even exceed the featuresand specifications offered by Samsung's Galaxy S series, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2022.This year, we’ve even seen a relatively new up and comer, iQoo, take a stab at this segment. Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra with its S-Pen and unique camera hardware is in a league of its own.So, where does that leave the Galaxy S22 and the Galaxy S22+? Let's find out in this review.I received the Samsung Galaxy S22 in Phantom White and the Galaxy S22+ in Phantom Black.Both phones have identical design elements and only differ in size.The Galaxy S22 and the Galaxy S22+ both have back panels made of Gorilla Glass Victus+,compared to the plastic rear panel of the Galaxy S21.The displays of both the new models also have the same scratch protection.The new Galaxy S series siblings have moved past last year’s rounded aestheticfor a more chiselled look, with flatter sides and glass on the front and rear.Both smartphones have polished aluminium frames. The rear camera modules of both phones protrude by a few millimetres, making them wobble if you try to use them on a flat surface.Both devices are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance. The Samsung Galaxy S22 is small enough to be comfortable for one-handed use.In fact, it's as compact as Google's budget Pixel 4abut manages to squeeze in a larger display due to its narrow bezels.The larger Galaxy S22+ was less easy to use because of its slippery rear panel, in my experience.Both phones did a fine job at resisting fingerprints.Compared to the Galaxy S22+, I found it difficult to type quickly on the Galaxy S22's display with two hands,although leisurely one-hand typing was not a problem.The Galaxy S22 has a 6.1-inch display, while the Galaxy S22+ has a larger 6.6-inch panel.Both are full-HD+ Super AMOLED panels with 120Hz maximum refresh rates.Display colours were a bit oversaturated at the default 'Vivid' setting on both phones,but I could tweak things to my liking. The displays also support HDR10 and HDR10+ playback,and this worked as expected across apps and services, showcasing deep blacks and vibrant colours.Samsung's latest flagships run One UI 4.1 based on Android 12.Sweetening the deal is Samsung's claim to provide four years of Android OS upgrades.The theming engine works well. Upon changing the wallpaper, the system will prompt you to choose a colour palettebased on the wallpaper), and will apply those colours to the icons, keyboard and widgets.Preinstalled third-party apps are limited to Microsoft's Office, OneDrive, LinkedIn and Outlook.There are also plenty of Samsung apps such as Samsung Pay, Galaxy Health etc.Thankfully, I could uninstall most of the unwanted ones.The Samsung Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+ (along with the Galaxy S22 Ultra) are the first S series smartphones with Qualcomm SoCs in India, rather than Samsung's Exynos hardware.Gaming was not a problem on either smartphone. However, I noticed that the Galaxy S22 often got warmer than the Galaxy S22+ while playing games such as Call of Duty: Mobile, at the 'Very High'graphics and 'Max' frame rate settings. The touch sampling rate on both displays was spot on,and I faced no problems with responsiveness when playing competitive first-person shooters.I also noticed both smartphones getting a bit warm when using the camera app. The frame and theback panel around the rear cameras got quite hot when shooting video or stills, be it day or night.The Samsung Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+ have identical camera setups. Both have a 50-megapixel primarycamera with PDAF and OIS, a 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3X optical zoom and OIS, anda 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 120-degree field of view. A 10-megapixel camera (with PDAF) on the front takes care of selfies.Photos taken with the primary camera on each of these phones in daylight  looked sharp and showcased good dynamic range,but I noticed some barrel distortion towards the edges,which was a bit odd since I wouldn’t expect this from the main camera on any phone. The colours and saturation in these images were spot-on.Ultra-wide-angle photos came out well but lacked the level of detail present in photos taken with the primary cameras.The telephoto cameras captured some crisp photos and were useful when shooting close-ups of human subjects or objects.Selfies came out sharp and with good depth and dynamic range when shot using auto mode. Portrait mode using the selfie cameras showcased good edge detection and dynamic range.Photos taken in low light (using the auto mode) showed good detail in the textures of objects but fell short of dynamicrange, with little detail in the shadows. Noise was under control, but noticeable in some images.Switching to Night mode helped bring out more detail, boosted the dynamic range, and suppressed noise better. Telephoto shots in low light were sharp but had plenty of noise.  Night mode improved the quality drastically but these photos appeared a bit soft. Photos taken with the ultra-wide-angle cameras in low light looked a bit too noisy in auto mode.Night mode improved things, but these images still looked soft and lacked detail.Videos shot in daylight showcased good dynamic range and stabilisation, whether I recorded at 1080p or 4K.8K video recordings had some flickering issues and looked choppy.Videos shot in low light looked impressive and showcased good dynamic range, with noise kept well under control.Stabilisation was also impressive.Battery life was quite good on both smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S22's 3,700mAh batterygot me through a full day, which usually included about an hour of gaming, video streaming and some camera usage.The Galaxy S22+ performed as expected, lasting about a day and a half with its 4,500mAh battery. I used my own 61W USB PD charger to charge both phones, since neither one comes with a charger.The Galaxy S22 managed a full charge in 1h 33mwhile the Galaxy S22+ was fully charged in 1 hour and 42 minutes. Indeed, both smartphones charge quite slowly compared to the competition, most of which come with their own proprietary chargers.The Galaxy S22's 128GB variant is priced at Rs. 72,999 in India and the 256GB variant sells for Rs. 76,999.The 128GB variant of the Galaxy S22+ is priced at Rs. 84,999, and the 256GB variant is priced at Rs. 88,999.Despite mounting competition in the premium Android smartphone space in India, I think the Samsung Galaxy S22 is still worth your attention as it's currently one of the best compact flagships in the market. With the Galaxy S22+, things aren't so clear-cut.It’s harder to justify the higher price for only a slightly larger battery and display. New and recent smartphones from iQoo, Vivo and OnePlus clearly offer a lot more such as higher resolution displays,unique camera systems, and faster charging.The Galaxy S22+ will still appeal to existing Samsung users looking to upgrade from an older Plus-sized Galaxy phone.And that’s it for our review of the Galaxy S22 and S22+.What do you think about Samsung’s new flagships?Sound off in the comments below.

exclusively on best buy available with in-store  pickup fast delivery options so don't miss the  opportunity so i've been using the galaxy s42  ultra completely naked like with no protection at  all it surprisingly looks clean with very minor  scuffing which is nothing compared to what we have  seen from some of the other galaxy s2 ultra users  if you're gonna buy this phone then i definitely  recommend you to put a skin or a case now let's  talk about what i was wrong about regarding the  s22 series well i recently got to try the galaxy  s42 plus shout out to my buddy lover tech and my  god this is the best smartphone design right now  i'm not saying samsung's best i'm saying best  overall that's how honestly i feel about this  phone again i'm saying this after using the s3  ultra for a month plus time the in-hand feel  of the galaxy s2 plus combined with those premium  slim bezels like this thing is just really really  good and it's something that you cannot experience  without actually using the phone in hand and that  is what i was wrong about because i didn't get  to try this phone out before in real life yes  the ultra has a long range zoom and of course the  s pen but if you're fine without that then the  camera on the s3 plus is very good as well like  for the most part the images are very similar to  what we get from the s3 ultra and it also got a  pretty good 3x optical zoom which is a range that  you see on most flagships i can't believe i'm  saying this but i actually wouldn't mind switching  to the plus with that being said the long range  zoom on the s3 ultra is hard to let go i mean i'm  fine with not using the s pen but i really really  enjoyed using the zoom on this thing especially  with all this traveling the camera on this thing  is just phenomenal it's an all-in-one package for  pretty much everything you want to shoot like  i said i was at the champions league game and  i was able to get clear zoom shots of the match  i have to say this was the best phone to take  to this incredible match experience something that  i've noticed while playing with these different  cameras on the back is that the switching of the  lenses is still not as snappy as i see on the  iphone 13 pro max it's still really really good  but sometimes it's not super smooth i've posted  videos from the s42 ultra to my instagram stories  and everyone was asking which phone i used because  the quality looked really good so the s52 ultra  is a solid phone for social media usage as well  as long as you don't regard videos from the  third party camera apps photos and selfies are  fine with the instagram and snapchat app but for  videos always use the built-in camera application  as for general photos in almost all situations  this phone does a really really good job the  dynamic range the colors everything is on point  the portrait mode edge detection on this thing  is the best on any phone video performance is  also really good in daytime in most scenarios  you're gonna get a great performance a nice lens  flexibility but in terms of low light challenging  situations samsung still needs to improve its  game i love its ultra wide angle camera but it's  not suitable for low light videos i mean the best  performance i've seen is on the fine x5 pro the  ultraviolet lens on that thing is really really  good so moving forward i would like to see a good  ultrawide angle camera upgrade on next generation  flagship but the main lens gets the job done now i  was super disappointed when it comes to samsung's  45 watt charging i mean you guys already probably  know about how samsung has optimized their charger  in a way that it's barely an improvement over  their previous 25 watt charger so if you're  getting the s2 ultra don't buy the 45 watt  charger now taking a look at the display it is  really really good bright no problems whatsoever  now speaking of software update i'm running  the latest march update for the s202 ultra  and performance wise this thing is really smooth i  haven't really faced any slowdowns whatsoever the  120hz refresh rate is also very consistent so  overall the performance is good even with just  eight gigs of ram on my very end this phone keeps  up all the important consistent apps that i use  in the background without any issue which  are basically four to five applications but  i highly recommend 12 gigs of ram if you are a  power user the s-pen on this thing is evergreen  with so many options to play with i'm glad that  it now comes with inside the phone personally  i've not used the s-pen that much but i know a lot  of people will appreciate this productivity option  now one thing i wish that i can magically improve  on this phone is battery life samsung despite  all their optimization despite all their geos  throttling drama they still cannot beat the iphone  in terms of the battery performance not just with  the battery drain test but in real life as well  there's actually no real battery improvement on  the s12 ultra compared to the s21 ultra from last  year you can get about five to seven hours of  screen on time on average on this phone which is  pretty typical of an android flagship phone  you can expect a bit less especially if you use  5g but overall it doesn't come close to what i  experienced on my 13 pro max it's still the phone  that i blindly trust when it comes to battery so  if battery life is the most important thing to you  then the iphone 13 pro max is hard to beat if you  look at the history of samsung flagship phones  from last three generations battery is one area  where they haven't really been improved that much  again i'm not saying that it's a deal breaker  or anything but i just wish that it was as good  as the iphone 13 pro max so overall the asteroid  ultra is a fantastic option a fantastic flagship  probably the best on the android field i don't  think samsung will face any real challenge this  year maybe with the pixel 7 pro but right now  this is the best that android has to offer i wish  we had better chairs better battery performance  faster charging speeds but uh yeah the s range  ultra still overall is a really really good option  and i've had a really good time using this phone  over this full month again design wise the galaxy  s20 plus is the best especially with that minimal  bezel display and if you're fine with not having  a super long range zoom then galaxy s2 plus  is also a great choice it's 200 cheaper than the  galaxy s2 ultra if you guys have any questions  feel free to comment down below with that  being said i'll see you guys later peace out
F7Svb6V3XR4,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"Hey guys! It's your Tech Girl, Mary.And welcome back to our channel.For today's video...is actually going to be excitingbecause we'll talk about the new S22 series.Yes, the moment you're watching this video,it's actually now official. They releasedthree new smartphones for their S seriesthat is the flagship lineup.We have the Samsung Galaxy S22, the Samsung Galaxy S22+and of course, the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.But since three is too much for us to squeezeinto this video right now, we will only be talkingabout the S22 and the S22+.Yes, the S22 Ultra guys is in a separate video.So in a bit, you can watch it.I'm pretty sure guys that the Ultra deservesa separate video, because it is the ultra.Do take note that I don't havethe actual units with me as of the moment,but I was invited to shoot and actually experiencethe new S22 phones.But I assure you guys that even thoughSamsung invited us, this is not sponsored at all.Before we start for our S22 and S22+ hands-on,I just want to say that Samsung also launchedthree new tablets.So if there are three new smartphones,there are also  three new tablets.We have the Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+,and the Galaxy S8 Ultra.Before we start, of course, I'm pretty surethat you want to know how much are the two new phonesof Samsung.And as far as I know  right now...Anyway, if this is wrong, I will be correcting it.If not, it will remain the same.The Samsung Galaxy S22 5G retails for Php45,990for the 128GB and Php49,990 for the 256GB.And of course, for the S22+ 5G,it's Php56,990 for the 128GBand Php60,990 for the 256GB.Okay. So what  did I experienceduring the shoot?Actually guys, the S22 and S22+,its looks didn't have any redesigning that happened.It's basically still the same.But the good news is we got four new colorwaysthat is not present in the S21.The white, black, pink, and the teal.Actually guys, I'm not sure if it's called teal,but it's got kind of a blue-green color.They are also  all matte finish.But if you'll notice guys in our footage,the color pink and white phones for the S22 and the S22+,its main camera setup is silvery.And then of course, for the blackand the blue-green S22 and S22+,they have the same colorway, or basically they just usedone color on them and it's not two-toned.And what you heard is right, the color choicesfor the S22 and the S22+ are the same.The only change  is the color that we havefor the S22 Ultra, which again,we will be talking about on the next video.By the way, for the size reference,the smallest phone in the series,which is again, the vanilla S22has the same height with the iPhone 13 Pro.Yup. We can't compare it with the sizeof the iPhone 13 Mini.This is only with their height. But when it comesto the width,  it's evident that the sizeof the regular iPhone 13 and 13 Pro are thicker.Now that you guys already know the sizeof the regular S22, which is again,6.1-inches, the Samsung Galaxy S22+is a bit bigger at 6.6-inches of display.Both the Samsung Galaxy S22 and S22+ has the power buttonand volume rockers on the right.And below, here is their speakers, USB type-C portand of course, the SIM tray.And speaking of the SIM tray guys, is it expandablevia microSD card?As usual, it's not expandable but it's dual SIM.I also noticed guys that in our in-displayfingerprint sensor, its placement is not weird.It's not too low unlike on thosein the Samsung A series that is a bit too lowfor my taste. Of course, in the S22and S22+, my relaxed position is where my thumb is placed.So it's okay for me. And what's importantis it's responsive.Anyway, overall, it wasn't too heavy for me,especially on the regular S22 since it only weighsat 167g.And then of course, for the S22+,it weights at 195g.They both feel  very solid, guys.When I held it and I experienced themfor that day,I felt that the smartphone that I was holding is a flagship.And I think the material that they used in thiswas improved  since it's alreadyCorning Gorilla Glass Victus+.(transition music)Now, I know you want to know our camera specificationson the S22 and the S22+.So let's talk about it.They both now have 50MP f/1.8that has dual pixel autofocus and of course, OISfor its main camera.It also has the 12MP ultra wide.They also both have the 10MP telephoto lens.And lastly a 10MP f/2.2 aperturethat has dual pixel autofocus as well.So yes, what you heard is right.The main camera leveled up on both phones,because if you'll remember before on the S21,we only have  a 12MP for the main camera.And I must say, I was disappointed last year.But then, if there's an upgrade, there's a downgrade.I'll just tell you guys that the telephoto lens beforewas actually 64MP.So yup, you might want to take note of that.But if you're not into taking photos zoomed,then maybe having a higher megapixelsas a main camera is much betterthan a higher megapixels telephoto lens.(transition music)Okay. Another controversial here in our S22 seriesis of course, the chipset.It's not controversial, but of course,the most asked question.Why? Because we actually have two kind of chipsetsthat are being released.It's either the Exyonys 2200 or the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.In the past few years, Exynos is what is always being releasedby Samsung here in the Philippines.But for this year guys, it's actually neither of the two.We actually have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 895as its chipset.And not only  the plus and the vanilla onebut also the S22 Ultra.This may actually be a good news,especially for our Snapdragon fans.It's just sad that I didn't able to play the smartphones.But definitely guys, if ever we have them,I will do the review of the beautyof the Snapdragon 895 and of course,our AnTuTu scores.As far as I know guys, 8GB is the availablein the S22 and the S22+.And we have  two storage configurations,it's either 128GB or 256GB.(transition music)Now, for the battery. They are both small phones,so is their battery small too?Actually it's kind  of weird guys,because the  Samsung Galaxy S22 nowonly has 3,700mAh.And we used to have, on its predecessor,4,000mAh.So it kind of downgraded.The S22+ is the same, from 4,800mAh,we now only have 4,500mAh.I'm not sure why  this happenedto our battery capacity. But I'm hopingthat hopefully the new chipset is efficient enoughand the battery life won't change as muchon these two phones.By the way,  there's kind of a lot of choiceswhen it comes to cases, kind of similarto the kind of cases that we gotfrom the Samsung Galaxy  Z Flip 3.it is actually part  of the preorder.So in case you missed the preorder,it's kind of a waste.But these are just cases, guys, so it's not that muchof a big deal.Anyway, I'll be putting the linkon where you can actually preorder.(transition music)Before we forget our displayon the Samsung Galaxy S22 and the S22+...Sorry, guys, that our display is kind of in the end.I forgot. It's kind of hard to talk without holdingthe actual devices.For the S22, we actually have, again,6.1-inches of full HD+ dynamic AMOLED display.And for the S22+, it has 6.6-inchesof full HD+ dynamic AMOLED display.And they both have 120Hz of refresh rate.So yes, that's basically it.I apologize again if that's not enough for you.This is not yet our review.So, see you guys on our next video,which is the  Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.See you guys. Bye!"

B8DjoSNGwQo,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"What do you want in a phone?Nice, bright screen, fast refresh rate, fast charge,latest chip, tons of ram, stupid storage up to 1 terabyte.This is definitely a beast of a phone and it’s definitely going to be the one to beat for the rest of the year.The 10x just pinged his eyeballs! It justBoy can you zoom in thoughLook at the detail on just my sweater, you can see the fabric.Things like improved video stabilisation, better low light performance, more precise portrait mode cutouts Ah they did it, man they did it.The Ultra does come with the same 5000mAh battery,which is impressive considering they also had to leave room for the S Pen.I found that overall this is a really fast phone that can pretty much throw whatever you want at it and it will be able to handle the task. If you want power, this thing absolutely delivers. and now you have the pen input as well for extra flexibility even improved the S Pen's latency down to 2.8 milliseconds so it should feel even more responsive when you're jotting down notes or sketches.Like if you didn't experience that before, it's arguably a little more comfortable This screen gets extremely bright. One of the brightest screens I have ever seen. This is top tier stuff. Technically we're looking at more efficient displays all aroundIt's just an easy buy."

qFIGhNJXZtw,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"Terrible. Okay, here's what happened.Imagine this glass is my Samsung  22 plus it'ssitting in my pocket right here.Look, phones get dropped all the time.This little mishap it's one of life's great random events.One I could have no way predicted or prevented.At least that's what I'm saying in my email to Samsung.But it does reiterate one thing, and that is that your phone is never,ever impervious to faults, no matter how many numbers or Latin wordsare at the end of that gorilla glass name.Woah, I almost broke it again.Always get yourself a case. I didn't.And now I look like a fool.Anyway, with my chances of ever getting a review unit from Samsung ever again.Absolutely. Shattered.I'm here to answer this one question.Should you buy the S22 plusOver the past three weeks that I've been using it,the S22 plus has slipped into my life as seamlesslyas it slipped out of my pocket and onto the road.It hasn't wowed me.But it also hasn't, like, ridiculously angered me in any way.It's kind of just been doing phone stuff and it's been doing it well. Hmm.There is a word for that. It's boring.But why is that?It's got an amazing screen.Top of the line specs, 5G, an amazing camera system.It's pretty much got everything in a phone that you could ask for, right?Well, yeah, it's because we saw a lot of this in the S21 just last year.Also, side note, I've got the S22 plus here,but it is very similar to the S22There's no difference in what it can do besides the slightly biggerbattery and screen.So everything I say here does kind of apply to the S22 as well.Ultimately, it just kind of means there'snot a whole lot of interesting stuff to talk about with these phones.For example, how's the design? Yeah, good.It looks a lot like last year and I loved last year's.How about the processor?That one is new and it's also really good.Here's a benchmark test.If that sort of thing interests you and you can see it's pretty much one of,if not the best Android phone out there right now.Anecdotally and without getting too technical.Yeah, it basically opens everything instantly.And you can just switch between apps as much as you like.The battery is kind of interesting in that it's gotten worse than last year.This is because the phone overall is slightly smaller than last year's model.So it's got a smaller battery, which is kind of at odds with thatbrighter screenI've been using the Galaxy Z flip since September.This thing dies so quickly it's kind of crazy to go backto a phone that can last longer than a day.But once I did get used to a normal battery again, I was whelmed.I was welcomed by the battery life of this thing.Not overwhelmed, just regular whelmed.Did I make that up or is that a thing? I'm not going to Google it.You can. Tell me in the comments.The battery is certainly still good on this.It could last about two days when I wasn't using this for reviewing purposes.So just using it like a regular phone. Wwhen I was testing it or when I was usingapps that kept the screen on like the apps, the camera watching videos.That's when it was timeto bust out the battery bank because, yeah, it would die within a day.Of course, battery use is pretty subjective to how you use your phone,but we do have scientific battery tests here at Finder.You can read more about those in the description.Let's talk about the screen.It's super bright It maxes out at 1750 nits,which is very impressive, but ultimately a little unnecessary.The 1300 nits the s21+ can output will do just fine.It also runs at 120 hertz, but only when it needs to.It does get as low as 48 hertz when you don't need all that smoothscrolling motion.By doing so, it'll conserve the battery a bit more.There is one thing that I think is pretty interesting about this phone.Can you tell what it is, by the way? I'm holding it.Yeah, it's the camera.All right.Here's a collection of shots I took over the past few weeks.The wide and ultra wide just pull so much weight.They're gorgeous.No matter what you point it at. The three times.Telephoto, though, is a bit less impressive.It gets the shot,but it wasn't really something I was happy with, at least compared to the other two.I like this photo of these dogs, though.Yeah, maybe with the right light it does alright.It does have that classic Samsung over sharpened overvibrant look, which some people love, butI cannot stand.But you know what? Samsung know what they're doing here.This vibe lends itself to sharing.You can very quickly snap a shot and post it knowing that it's going to be at leasta little bit striking. Nightography or as we say in the biz,night photography, was a big part of Samsung's launch around these phones.And it does alright but still has varying results.Like it's not magic.You still need to hold the camera fairly still.So the shutter can spend its time capturing the image.Same with portraits, actually.I know they made a big deal about being able to separate your hairsfrom the background when doing portrait mode.So you can get that blurry background.That's just not true.I'm having a terrible time with this. Samsung,do you expect me to cover my hair?I'm wearing a hat right now for a reason.Look at this. Actually doesn't look too bad.Now, if you're a hobbyist or pro photographer, good news.Samsung's expert raw app can be downloaded to the S22+from the Galaxy Store.And I reckon this could be the thingthat makes the S22 line up worth it for photographers.The app itself is pretty basic and gives you similar options to the pro mode.In the main camera app, you have actually been ableto take raw photos on most Android phones for years,but this app seems to have a little bit more going on under the hood.You can see the difference here.You get similar file sizes,but the actual photo has a lot more computational photography behind it.It also has this button that immediately lets you edit the photo in library mobile,which I absolutely lovenow tovideo and I'll switch to the phone so you can see and hear what it's like.This is kind of what it's like in a curated lit setting,but I think it works really well pretty much everywherefor people who just like making videos or do it professionally.This phone is really, really good.I even used a few shots of 4K from this phone in my lastcouple of videos, and unless you're a big video nerd, it's barely noticeable.This was just the best camera for the job that I had on me at the time.The stabilization is also amazing.Like, here I am on a boat in mildly choppy ocean,but you wouldn't be able to tell the boat was rocking.I did notice sometimes that stabilization can overshoot when you're trackingleft to right, and then it kind of needs to snap back into place.But most of the time it's as smooth as a smoothjazz sped smooth as a baby's bottom.It's a smooth criminal.It's it's smooth. It's very smooth.FM.what's happening?It does also do 8K video, which I just switched to.You might have noticed it cropped in a little bit.It's also only 24 frames per second.And overall, it just looks a little bit worse than the 4K stuff.I don't know, unless you're making a movie on thisfor some reason, I'm not really sure you need to touch the 8K mode.It's just a sure fire way to fill up your hard drive with unnecessarilybig footage.Really, it's just here to make the phone seem cooler than it is.Well, so that 8K section took me about 2 minutes to shootand the phone is weirdly warm after doing that.Overall for photographers and video creators.Yeah, the S22 line up could be the perfect phone for you.But once again, all of these older phones will have accessto the expert raw app by mid this year.Additionally, and this is pretty common with a lot of high end phones nowthere is no expandable storage on the S22 line up, and I thinkthat's a huge missed opportunityif they're trying to entice either photographers and videographers.At the end of the day, if you're taking a lot of raw photos or 4Kfootage or 8K footage, if you're deranged, then this is going to fill up quicklyand this phone only gets up to 256 gigs of hard drive space.At least the Ultra can get up to one terabyte.But hoo boythat is one spicy price.So should you buy the s22+?This isprobably one of the best phones ever made, and I think that's pretty safe to say,but I don't think many people need to buy it. For photographers,if you're looking for something that can occasionally stand infor an actual camera, then this could definitely be the choice for you.But the S22 Ultra is the one with the better camera system,and even the older Ultra have a better camera system and still get that raw app.Oh, and they're getting cheaper.This is a powerhouse of the camera.There are just better options. For everyone elseif it's time to upgrade your phone, then this will not let you down.Samsung is going to support it for over four years,but the S21 is almost the exact same phone.It's cheaper and the battery is actually better.I would recommend looking into S21 sales before going out and buying one of these.And as always, with these flagships,if you don't need that epic processing powerand you just take photos for social media and fond memories,you'll probably be happy with something a lot cheaper.I reviewed two phones that fit that very description right here.I think they're great. Check it out."
8oLMnoc1zRg,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"(upbeat music)- What's up guys?Saf here on SuperSaf TV,and this is my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra reviewafter two months.Why do I have two S22 Ultra's here?Well, one of these is theQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 versionand the other is the Exynos 2200.I've used each of these for a month now,so, hopefully I'll be able to give you moreof a unique perspective based on real-world usage.So, if you've been following me on social media,you'd have seen that I've been posting a lotwith the S22 Ultra.And that is because it has been, so far,my favorite smartphone of 2022.And that's because it ticks offpretty much all of the boxes for me,like I think it will do for most people.Let's initially start off with the design.I do really like the design of the S22 Ultra,and you'll notice that we do have more of a boxier designcompared to what we had on the S21 Ultra.Now, if you haven't already noted,the S22 Ultra has now been mergedwith the Samsung Galaxy Note series.So, there's no longer going to be a separate Note device.This is what the Note has now become and evolved intoand that is the reason for this updated design.Now, I'm going to be honest with you,I personally do prefer the designof the S21 Ultra last year.I really like that Contour-Cut camera module,as well as the curved edges,which make it a little bit more comfortable to hold.But the S22 Ultra still has a really good design.We've got matte finishes across the board.We've got more color options this year,four by default,as well as three exclusive colors from Samsung.com.I'll leave a link to those in the description,which will also give you $100 of instant Samsung Credit.And it still is really premium.We've got Gorilla Glass Victus+as well as Armor Aluminum.Now, this is supposed to be a little bit more durablecompared to the S21 Ultra last year.I'm not somebody who does a drop test,but by using both of these for a month,they've been absolutely fine.Now, we do have these individual camera rings,which might look okay,the only issue with these is that they do collecta lot of dust around the edges,unless you use a case.Now, we still have IP68 water and dust resistance,so if you do get some water over thisthat's absolutely fine.And this is quite impressive consideringwe also do have the S Pen,which we'll talk about a little bit later.What I want to talk about next is one of my favorite thingsabout the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra,and that is the display.Now, I know I sound like a bit of a broken recordbecause I say this every year for Samsung flagship devices,but the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultrahas the best smartphone display on the market right now.Now Samsung make AMOLED displaysfor a lot of the competition,including for iPhones,and I have a feeling that they save their best displaysfor their flagship devices,and this really shows here on the S22 Ultra.It's sharp, thanks to its Quad HD+ resolution.The colors really pop with deep blacks,thanks to the Dynamic AMOLED technology.And animations are super smooth,thanks to the 120Hz LTPO 2.0 technology.Not only that, this is also the brightest displayon the market, with 1,750 nits,and if you're somebody like me who wear sunglassesand uses your smartphone a lot outdoors in sunlight,you're really going to appreciate this.Now, because we have LTPO technology,it means it can go all the way down to around 1Hz,which is ideal for the always-on display.Always-on displays are something that I absolutely love,and it's great to know that eventhough we do have this high refresh rate,it's not really going to have a significant impacton the battery.Now, there is still this punch out,so we don't have under-display camera technology as yet,and as we've seen on the Fold3,yes that can be done, but it's still not perfect,especially for a flagship device like this.And personally speaking, I really don't mind this punch out.I've kind of got used to it,and it also allows for some wallpapers.If you guys want the Spider Saf wallpaper,I'll leave that link down in the description below.One thing that we do have under the displayis the Ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner.Now, this is the same as what we had last year.So this is the 3D Sonic Gen 2, and it works flawlessly.It's fast. It's accurate.I always advise registeringthe same fingerprint a couple of times,just to make it that much better.And yes, it would've been nice to have Qualcomm'snew 3D Sonic Max,which will allow you to use two fingers at the same time,which would make things a lot more secure,especially when it comes to banking apps.But nevertheless, the Ultrasonic fingerprint scanneris absolutely great on the S22 Ultra.Now, the display is curved on both sidesand this curve is more pronouncedcompared to what we had on the S21 Ultra.And although this does look goodfrom a design point of view,when it comes to practicality,I do prefer flatter displayslike what we've got on the S22 and the S22 Plus.And it's also so much easier to get a screen protectorfor flatter displays.Nevertheless, the S22 Ultra has an excellent display overalland I don't think anybody's going to be disappointed with it.- Hey! Side Saf here.Ignore this guy for a second.Look, around 60% of you guys watching are not subscribed.I can see, I can see, you know.So, if you haven't already,then please consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon,so you can see the latest content that we produce.Also, don't forget to smash that like buttonif you're enjoying the video so far.It really helps with the YouTube algorithm.Okay, I'll let you guys get back.- Okay, so you heard the man.If you haven't already,then maybe consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon.That way you'll get to know as soon as I upload a new video.Let's now talk about the cameras.So, the S22 Ultra has excellent cameras,some of the best that you're going to find out there.And although on paper they do seem pretty similarto what we had last year,that's not necessarily a bad thingbecause the S21 Ultra still has great cameras,which still do hold up.So, we do have a total of four cameras,as well as a laser autofocus sensor.The ultra-wide camera is one of the best out there.You've got excellent dynamic range, lots of detail.And this also has the ability to refocusso you can also get some macro shots,which look excellent.The primary camera has been improved.We've got lots of detail. It's very sharp.You've also gotten a Detail Enhancer mode,which will let you take more detailed imagesat 108MP if that's something you're into.And we have the best zoom on any smartphone right now.We've got two zoom cameras.We've got a 3x optical zoom,as well as a 10x optical zoom.Now the 10x optical zoom camera has excellent results,even up to around 30x.You can go all the way up to 100x,although I find that's a little bit creepy.And yes, you can take pictures of the moonif that's something that you like to do.Now, one big improvement that we do have on the S22 Ultra,is when it comes to portraits.If you remember seeing my S21 Ultra review,you'd have heard me complainingabout portraits on the S21 Ultra,and that's because you had the optionof taking portraits at 1x and 2x.The issue was, that the S21 Ultra did not havea 2x optical zoom camera,so it was actually digitally zooming for that 2x effect,which was very, very soft.Now I know for a fact that Samsung is watching my videosand taking on that feedback,because the S21 Ultra did get an updatelater on in the year,which allowed you to take portraitswith that native 3x zoom camera.With the S22 Ultra,Samsung has completely ditched the 2x zoomfor the portrait mode,and we have 1x and 3x portraits,which look really good,some of the best that you're going to get out there.So, Samsung is using a new AI Depth Mapping algorithm,which can even isolate individual hairs.And when this hits, oh, it really hits.You can see this example here,where it's actually picked up a single strand of hairon my beard,as well as the little fluffy hair on my ears,which is a bit too much if you ask me.But nevertheless, the edge detection, in my opinion,is the best that you're going to find on any smartphone,and Samsung has completely nailed thiswhen it comes to portrait mode.We've also got a great selfie camerawith lots of detail and excellent dynamic range,a really good portrait mode as well.And like before,we do have an option of having natural or bright selfies.Samsung devices traditionally used to make selfiesvery bright,but now you have this option of just turningon natural selfies,and in my opinion, you get much better results.For video, the S22 Ultra shoots excellent video.I would say some of the best videowhen it comes to Android.I still think that the iPhone has more options.It does shoot overall better video.Now I have done a detailed SuperSaf-style camera comparisonbetween the iPhone 13 Pro Maxand the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultraif you want to see that.I'll link that in the cards under the description.We also have some new video modes on the S22 Ultra.There is auto framing, which will track you.This is something that I didn't really find myself usingover the last couple of months.And we also have an improved portrait video mode,which does actually a pretty good job overallof isolating you from the background.But again, this is something that's at 10 ATP,and although it's okayit's not something that I found myself using much.Now there is 8K video,but this hasn't really progressedover the past couple of years.It's pretty much the same as what we've had previously.Yes, you can shoot at 8K,but this is capped to just 24 frames a second,and although that is the correct frame rate,I'd like to have options.Also, there's no consistency,because you can shoot 24 frames a second with 8K,but you can't shoot at 24 frames a secondat any other resolution.8K still crops in quite significantly,which means that you have to stand really far back.And also there isn't much stabilizationso you can't really use it handheld,you'd only be able to use it on a tripod.So yeah, I really think Samsung needs to improve8K video recording,because it really hasn't changed.Now, another thing that we do need to touch onwhen it comes to the cameras,are the differences between the Qualcomm versionand the Exynos version.Now, you might be wondering,why would there be any differences?Well, the thing is,these chips come with their own image signal processors,which means that when the images are capturedthey are processed slightly differently.Now, generally speaking,images are pretty much neck and neckand the software does make them pretty similar.However, I did notice a few differenceswhen it came to portraits.I found that skin tones were a little bit more vibranton the Exynos version compared to the Qualcomm version.And in certain cases,I also found that the Exynos versionhad slightly better dynamic range.Check out this example.My forehead is much better exposedon the Exynos version compared to the Qualcomm version.However, there was certain situations where theQualcomm version performed bettercompared to the Exynos version.Take a look at this example on this selfie.The portrait mode has worked better on the Qualcomm version,and it's given a much better cutoutcompared to the Exynos version.Now, I'm pleased to say, generally speaking overall,the cameras are quite similar.I am still not happy that they're not completely consistentand we do have these differences,but you're only going to notice these differencesif you are comparing them side by side,like I have done.How about performance and differences?Well, you'll be pleased to know that generally speaking,the S22 Ultra,whether you get the Qualcomm version or the Exynos version,performs really well in your day-to-day,and I've really not had any issues whatsoever.But, if you are somebody who games a lotand if you don't want to go into the specific details,then I would say that the Qualcomm version gets the edge.Now, I'm not somebody who games too much,but my friends, Thunder E, from Booredatworkand Tom, The Tech Chap are,and they've actually done detailed performance testsincluding looking at things like heating and frame rates.I'll leave their videos linked down in the description.But overall, although CPU performance is pretty similar,the Qualcomm Snapdragon version does get the slight edgewhen it comes to GPU performance.And more importantly,it seems like the Qualcomm Snapdragon versionis more optimized for games,compared to the Exynos version.Now, this makes a lot of sense,because the Qualcomm 8 Gen 1is going to be on many more devices.So as a game developer,you're obviously going to optimize your gamesfor the version that's going to be used on many devices,rather than one that's going to be used on a few devices.So for example, on PUBG,right now you can get up to 60 frames a secondon the Qualcomm version,whereas you can only get 30 frames a secondon the Exynos version.Now, if you're somebody who doesn't really game,then this probably isn't going to make muchof a difference to you,but just something to keep in mind.Now, if you are somebody who really wants a Qualcomm versionand wants to import it in,then do keep in mind that some 5G bandsmay not be supported,because there are different bandsin the US compared to the UK.So, for example,my Qualcomm version here in the UK on Vodafone,does not get 5G.If, despite that, you really, really wantthe Qualcomm version,then I will leave some links down in the description below.On Amazon, it actually does calculate the importsand duty fees and things,so that might be quite useful.Now, another thing that the differencesin chipsets usually affect,is battery life.However, I'm pleased to say that after extensive testingand using these both for a month each,battery life has has been very good in bothand also very similar.I'm getting roughly between six to seven hoursof screen-on time,which for me is really good because I am a heavy user.Remember, screen on-time does vary from person to persondepending on your usage.However, as you probably already know,the S22 Ultra does not come with a charger includedout of the box.This is something you're going to have to buy separatelyif you do not already have one.The S22 Ultra does support either 25 or 45W charging,which is faster.However, from all the tests that I've seen,it's not significantly faster,you're going to get a slight improvement.So, personally speaking,I would say if you are going to buy a charger,just get the £20 or $20, 25W charger.It's really not worth spending the £25 or $30 extraon the 45W charger, in my opinion.I would say instead,use that money to buy a nice wireless charger,which will cost you around that much.I'll try to leave some links down in the description below.And although the charging speed is at 15Wso it's not crazy fast,it's still really convenient.Personally speaking,I just drop my S22 Ultra on my wireless chargerwhen I go to sleep,and I wake up to it fully charged.Reverse wireless charging is also supported,like it has been on previous generations.This is where you can use the S22 Ultrato charge some things like earbuds on the back of them.I really don't find myself using this.I used to use it sometimes when I used to be traveling,but now I'm not really traveling as much anymoreso I've only used this for this B-roll shotthat you can see on screen.The one thing that is impressive about the batteryis the fact that it's still the same size as the S21 Ultrathat we had last year,despite the fact that the S22 Ultra has an S Pen enclosed.Now, traditionally,Note devices would have a slightly smaller batterybecause they'd need space for the S Pen,but Samsung has managed to fit in the same size batterywithout increasing the weight too much.And that brings us on to the S Pen.Now, I'm somebody who really appreciates the S Pen,and I'm going to be honest, I don't use it every day,I probably use it maybe once or twice a week.But when I do use it, I'm so glad it's there,whether that be to sign a quick documentor to just edit an image.The precision that you get with the S Pen is unmatched,and yes, you have lots of different featureslike Air Command,where you can use thisas a remote trigger for your camera.Some things which you may or may not use,but just that convenience of having such a precise S Penwith 2.8 milliseconds of latency,which feels so, so smooth,the S Pen, for me, is a great addition.And if you're somebody who doesn't really use it,maybe use it once a month,it's not really coming in the waybecause it's tucked away inside the device,and it's not really giving you any compromises either.Now, when it comes to the speakers,we have excellent stereo speakers on the S22 Ultra.We've got one in the earpiece and one bottom firing.They sound really, really good.However, I do have a slight problemwith the positioning of the speaker.So, the speaker position is now on the left-hand siderather than being on the right-hand side,like we had on the S21 Ultra.Now, that might not seem like a big deal,but it is on the opposite side of the cameras.What that means is, when I'm gaming,obviously I don't want my hands touching the cameras,I usually game like this so the cameras are on this side.But what that it means is that I end up covering the speakerwith my hand.Now, when it was on the opposite side on the S21 Ultra,that wasn't an issue because it would never be covered.But now I do find myself covering itand I know a lot of people are going to sayyou just use headphones when you're gaming,and that's absolutely fine.I'm talking about personal experience,especially when I'm at home alone.Why do I want to put headphones on?I just use the speakers and then I end up covering them.So I would've liked to have had the positionon the opposite side.That's just something that might be minorfor a lot of people,but something that I do need to mention.Now, for software we do have One UI,which personally speaking is my favorite skin on Android.It allows for great one-handed usage.You've got lots of different customizations.And Samsung has been great with updates.I've already had multiple software updates on my S22 Ultras.And Samsung will also be supporting software updateslonger than most other manufacturers,which is a big, big plus.Finally, storage and pricing.So, this does start at the same pricethat the S21 Ultra did last year,although you will be paying morefor the larger storage versions.Starts with a base of 128GB.Personally speaking, I would go for the 256GB option,because this cannot be expanded,we do not have a microSD card slot.We didn't have one on the S21 Ultraso this really wasn't a surprise.The S22 Ultra does go all the way up to 1TB however,so if you are somebody who uses a lot of storage,that option is there for you if you'd like.Now, if you are interested in picking up the S22 Ultra,you can get $100 off instant Samsung Creditusing my special affiliate link in the description,and you can also get some pretty good trading deals.And that is the Samson Galaxy S22 Ultra.If you've made it this far on this video,I just want to say thank you, I love you.Virtual hug.I really appreciate you sticking around.To conclude, as mentioned at the start of this video,this is my favorite smartphone of the year so far,and I can easily recommend it.I think it ticks a lot of boxes for a lot of people.If you are somebody who's not really intothe Note vibe and the S Pen,then you can go for the S22 Plus,which is also an excellent smartphone.Or you could even go for the S21 Ultra from last year,which still holds up and is going to be availablefor less compared to the S22 Ultra.I have done a detailed hands-on comparisonof the S21 Ultra versus the S22 Ultra.That's going to be linked here.If you're interested to see what the camerasare actually like,compared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max,I've also done a detailed SuperSaf-style camera comparison,which I'll link over here.What do you guys think of the S22 Ultra?Are you going to be getting it?Do drop me a comment below. Let me know your thoughts.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did, then do smash that like button for me.And if you haven't already,then do make Side Saf's day by subscribing,and hitting that bell icon.Thanks for watching.This is Saf on SuperSaf TV, and I'll see you next time."
9nQ79dfjywY,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,
V9beUeBKxQE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 is probably the best  of the S22 series to buy. A device just as  powerful as the S22 Ultra in a more portable and  sleek form factor. While most are focused on its  more expensive and bigger siblings, it is easy  to miss just how good the base S22 actually is.  Stick around and I’ll tell you why! My name’s Izzi  and welcome to the channel. Now let’s get started! It’s been just over a month the S22 series  was launched and this one has been with me for  just over a week. Depending on your region you’ll  either get the Exynos 2200 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.  Nigeria gets the Snapdragon variant, but this  review unit I have here is the Exynos. It’s price  starts at 469,000 naira for the base version. One of the most interesting things about the S22  compared to its siblings is its size. In a time  where smartphones are reaching for the biggest  screen size possible, some of us still appreciate  a portable device that can be operated on one hand  without stress. The Samsung Galaxy  S22 comes portable at 6.1 inches. Its design while similar to the S21 is flatter  and despite its flat design profile it feels  lovely and comfortable on the hands. The frame is  not flat enough to stand without support like the  iPhones but I won’t use my phone standing anyways. The S22 comes in a couple of attractive colors and  I have to say this green is nothing short  of gorgeous. You get Gorilla glass victus  plus on both the display and the rear,  tough glass but you should probably still  use a case cos it’s still glass and can break. If you’re in Nigeria though, there’s a Samsung  care plus offering where you get complimentary  screen repair within the first year if you  accidentally break your screen, so you might  want to take advantage of that just in case. The S22 display is easily the best looking  display on any smartphone at the moment,  not just for its display quality but actually its  slim bezels with perfect symmetry. It is a Full HD  dynamic AMOLED display that can get really bright  with up to 1300 nits of peak brightness. You’ll  also appreciate that variable refresh rate 120hz  experience as the screen goes from about 48 to  120hz depending on what you have on your screen. Like we’ve seen from the most recent galaxy  devices, when you buy the S22 you’ll  only get a charging cable in the box.  The S22 supports 25watts charging and charges  pretty fast if you use the recommended charger. There are concerns about its battery being  just 3700mAh but from my experience so far  it seems pretty well optimised and gives me up  to 6 hours of screen on time on a full charge,  and its 25 Watts fast charging is actually pretty  fast, getting you from 0 to 100 within an hour.  Of course it’s still quite early to conclude  on its battery endurance so definitely expect  a later review after I spend more time using this. The software on the Samsung Galaxy S22 is Android  12 and OneUI 4.1 which I’ll say is quite  stable and gives you that lovely feature  packed One UI experience with some Material U  customisations. Samsung has promised 4 years  of major OS upgrades and an extra year of  security updates for this, more than Google  is offering for the Pixel devices. That is to  say you can use the S22 up to 4 years and not  be bothered about outdated software. That’s  Android 16 guaranteed, now that’s awesome. It might be the most portable and base variant of  the S22 series but make no mistake the Galaxy S22  packs as much power as the S22 Ultra. As a device  that packs the latest hardware and processing power in the form of the Snapdragon 8 Gen  1 or Exynos 2200 depending on your region,  the S22 will give you the performance  worthy of a flagship device in all aspects.  It comes at a base 8GB of RAM and 128GB of  internal storage which you sadly can’t expand,  but you can purchase the higher 256GB  version. Thanks to One UI 4.1 if 8GB of RAM  is not sufficient you can always use RAM Plus to  extend it by an additional 4GB or even up to 8GB. RAM plus is pretty much the device using from  available internal storage to support the RAM of  the device for improved multi tasking experience. You will find performance to be mostly fluid on  the Galaxy S22 and you can expect it to handle  whatever you throw at it without stress.  That it’s a portable device doesn’t mean it  can’t handle gaming. It is well and truly  capable of playing the most demanding  games just fine if you ever need it to. But speed, design and gaming is not all there  is to the Samsung Galaxy S22. It packs a well  optimised camera system which will give you great  looking photos even in tricky lighting conditions  thanks to its image processing. While this does  not have that 100x zoom like the Ultra variant,  30x zoom is pretty good enough if you ask  me, and Samsung’s image processing on the  zoom photos is actually quite impressive. Whether it’s selfies or portraits you’re  capturing on the S22 you will be pretty  satisfied with the results you get.  The edge detection on portraits look flawless even  on portrait video, and with advanced auto framing  the Galaxy S22 is able to adapt, keep focus and  frame the subject correctly while recording video  without any added effort from the user. Taking pictures or even videos at night  won’t be a problem on the Samsung Galaxy S22  as Samsung has improved a lot in that aspect. Still on the camera optimisations, it works better  with apps like Snapchat, Instagram or TikTok. There’s plenty to talk about when it comes  to the cameras of the Samsung Galaxy S22,  I’m talking super high res 8K video recording,  awesome image stabilisation and plenty others  which will require another video  to actually cover it properly,  but to summarise, you really can’t go wrong  with the S22 when it comes to the cameras. Okay, so this is portrait video on the Samsung  Galaxy S22, this looks...Edge detection is awesome.I know I’ve talked about its size before  but I really have to say it again,  this device looks and feels perfect and  you actually have to hold it to understand. Now, the only downsides I see to this device is the  lack of expandable storage and if you’re a heavy  user you might find yourself needing to charge  at least once before the end of your day. But  for the average user this is perfect and will only  get better with the continuous software support. So that’s my impressions on  the Samsung Galaxy S22 so far.  I feel it’s a great device and an easy  choice if you like your device portable,  stylish and still very powerful, and of course  this green color should be the color to get.  Do hit the thumbs up if this video was helpful  and also consider subscribing to the channel.Peace."
ldadR6XqiWE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,[Music]hey what's up mkbhd here and this is theall new samsung galaxy s22ultra freshly announced today and i gotsome hands-on time with this newflagship and you know what's funny wehaven't had a new samsung galaxy note intwo years since the note 20 in 2020 andso since then we've had all thesequestions like oh is samsung killing thegalaxy note are they donewith that line is it overbut i have a theorythis is a galaxy note now obviously notby name we're still calling this an s22ultra but clearly you know samsung waslooking for a little bit more of a wayto differentiate the ultra from the restof the galaxy s lineup and a reason tojustify this 1200 starting price sohonestly i wouldn't really be surprisedif samsung did behind the scenesactually make an s22 ultra and a note 22ultra and then look at them side by sideand likeyeah there's not really enoughdifferentiating these hereand then just booted the s22 ultra andkept the note 22 ultra and slotted it inat the top of the lineup but change thename so yes the phone i'm about to showyou is called the galaxy s22 ultra butuhyeah the note is back so i picked thisphone up and held it for the first timeand immediately all the memories ofprevious galaxy notes come back now likei said this slots in right above thegalaxy s22 and s22 plus i also have avideo about those two new phonesdropping at the same time as this one soif you're interested in those definitelycheck that out link below the likebutton but yeah this is the top of thatlineup so the new design that wasrumored is real the materials feelfamiliar you've got metal and gorillaglass victus plus you know the flat topand bottom the whole thing is ip68certified and then the shape well thisis the exact specific shape of thegalaxy notes of the past just with asatin back now and the new camera layoutthe satin back i love seems like theword ultra is associated with like asatin or matte non-glossy back and i'mall about that and of course low keywhile i of course love the matte black ithink the white one here will show thefewest fingerprints if you can keep itclean but the cameras are the weirdlooking part for sure there is no bigcamera bump no shelf on the corner likethe s21 ultra just individual camerarings that each protrude out the sameamount from that flat back and thecamera rings are shiny and actuallymatch the rails of the phone for eachcolorbut look i don't think it looks thatgreat it looked pretty basic to me inthe renders and it still does buthonestly most other phones camera bumpslook pretty lame too maybe this onelooks a little dumber with a case on itbecause you have to draw around thecamera cutouts and then it looks likethe letter p shape kinda meh i don'tknow it's a good thing you don't have tolook at the back of your phone all thetime you can get a case you like orsomething like thatit's just a bummer becausethe s21 series all looked so much betterand the s22 and s22 plus both still havethis better looking corner camera bumpdesignanyway the display up front on the ultraappears to be everything you'd expect ithink we kind of take it for granted alittle bit at this point because theyare consistently some of the absolutebest displays on any phone seems likethat's again what we're looking at here6.8 inches corner to corner 1440presolution 120 hertz max refresh rateand this is an ltpo2 display now so therefresh rate can modulate all the waydown to one hertz when not much ishappening for an even better mix ofefficiency and responsiveness also i wasable to turn on adaptive refresh ratemode and 1440p resolution at the sametime so that's good you know we knowit'll kill your battery but hey you payfor a lot of those pixels so you mightas well be able to use them all but yeahthis appears to be the world-classdisplay we expect again the selfiecamera cutout is still top center nottaking too many risks by putting itunderneath the display and theultrasonic fingerprint reader is stillin the same spot same size and you'vegot that little curve on each side ofthe screen the smaller s22s arecompletely flat and i prefer that thisone curves over the edges a little bitinto the side rails just like the othernotes you can see the little ultra wideband cut out on the rail under the powerand volume buttons and then of coursethe biggest new feature of the s22 ultrais a feature that came from the oldnotes which is the built-in stylus the spenlike i said it's a note so the belovedbuilt-in stylus returns to the bottomcorner of the phone pops in and outreversibly it has all the software thescreen off notes the super low latencyeverything that people loved about the spen before it's all still here and it'salso funny this year the s pens are allblack no matter what color phone you getbut just the cap of the pen will matchthe color of the rails which alsomatches the color of the camera rings itreally feels like this phone just picksup right where the old notes left offbecause other than the name basicallydoes exactly thatalso you might have noticed i haven'teven gotten to the specs yet but they'reexactly what you'd expect as a spec bumpfrom those older notes snapdragon 8 gen1 chip and it's gonna have the exynosversions in certain regions again butit's a new four nanometer chip and thenevery spec other than the baselineversion has 12 gigs of ram so it'llstart at eight but then every singleother one up to one terabyte of storagewill have 12 gigs of ram so you can specit up to that high sounds expensive butyou can go that high if you want to thebattery stays at the 5 000 milliamphours which is impressive given there isnow a cutout inside for the s pen andthere's 45 watt fast charging in theultra and the s22 plus but not in theregular no charger in the box but it'llsupport that fast charging if you giveit enough juice that's like 50 chargeadded in 20 minutes of being plugged inand these cameras are interestingthey're not bumped up so much in thehardware department but there sure are alot of new software features so you'restill looking at quad cameras the 108megapixel main camera the ultra wide a3x telephoto and a 10x telephoto butthen in the software there's a bunch ofstuff there's a new nona binning modefor high resolution nighttimephotography it'll combine the brightnessof binned photos with the detail of the108 megapixel mode there's an improvedpro mode with new raw formats they'redoing ai stereo depth mapping for betterportrait mode photos and also justplaying around with the extremelylimited time i had with hands-on itfeels like the 100x space zoom has evenmore improved stabilization that triesto kind of lock onto subjects presumablysomething contrast-based from what i cantell there's a lot of stuff i got totest on here especially in the cameradepartment to see if it's actuallybetter or more improved than last yearbut that should all be in the fullreview so for sure make sure you getsubscribed to be among the first to seethat full review when it does come outbut yeah i think we're pretty much allon the same page i am very pumped totest long termthe note 20 or s22ultra and all of its new features let meknow in the comment section below whatyou want to know about i mean there's abunch of interesting stuff the batteryof course is still huge maybe it's oneui 4.1 maybe it's the new camerafeatures maybe it's the style of stufflet me know i'll be hanging out downthere to figure it out and the fullreview will be coming up soon until thenmake sure you check out the s22 and s22plus video if you're interested in thoseas welland that's basically itthanks for watching catch you guys inthe next onepeace[Music]
hwXyefMJYLo,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,what's happening everyone my name is alex and  welcome back in today's video we are checking  out the latest mid-range device from samsung  the samsung galaxy a535g and comparing it to  samsung's flagship for 2022 the samsung galaxy  s22 now these two devices do look quite similar  so is it worth spending double the money to get a  samsung galaxy s 22 what do you get more wood s22  compared to something like the a53 5g well we're  definitely going to find out in today's video  all right starting with the boxes well they both  come in pretty small boxes and that means one  thing you are not gonna find a charger in the  box of the a535g or in the box of the samsung  galaxy s22 so you basically get a cable and you  have to buy your own charger they both support  25 watt fast charging but with the samsung  galaxy s22 you also get wireless charging  and reverse wireless charging so the a53 we don't  get wireless charging or reverse wireless charging  so that is an advantage for the s22 inside the e53  we have a 5 000 milliamp hour battery where inside  the s22 we have a 3700 milliamp hour battery so of  course the s22 will charge a bit faster because we  do have a smaller battery inside it now i did run  a test to see how much battery time we get um so  how much screen on time we get on each device and  i was able to get about 8 hours and 10 minutes on  the a535g compared to about 8 hours and 57 minutes  on the samsung galaxy s22 now keep in mind that  i've done this test connected to wi-fi only so no  4g or 5g connectivity and the device is basically  just played the youtube videos over and over i  did take some pictures as well with the a535g  so for this kind of test you're going to get  about eight hours of screen time on both devices  the screen on the a535g is also a bit bigger and  talking about the screens here so we have a 6.5  inches super amoled screen on the a535g compared  to a 6.1 inches screen on the samsung galaxy s22  this is also super amoled screen they both have a  1080p resolution and they both support 120 hertz  refresh rate let me just open screen so display  let me look for display on this one as welland motion smoothnessso they both support 120 hertz some  refresh rate now the biggest um differences  that you're going to notice for these two screens  is the brightness so the peak brightness for the  samsung galaxy s22 is 1300 nits where the  peak brightness for the samsung galaxy a53  is 800 nits indoors you're not gonna notice  a difference but if you do take the phones  outdoors in direct sunlight you will notice  a massive difference on the screen of the s22  so you will be able to see the screen of the  s22 much better than you're gonna be able to  see the screen of the a535g they both have  in-screen fingerprint scanners even though  the scanner on the s22 is slightly faster not  a whole lot faster but definitely a bit faster  than the one that we get on the a53 now looks  wise they do look quite pleasant both of them  even though the s22 does feel more premium so  first of all the frames on the devices the frame  on the s22 is made out of metal where the frame  on the a53 is made out of plastic the same goes  for the backs here so the back of the a535g is  made out of plastic and this is how it soundsand the back of the s22 is made out of glass  so it doesn't sound as cheap as that sound that  you get from the a53 all right looking at the  frames here on the left hand side they do look  quite similar um nothing there um the same kind  of goes at the top we basically have a whole forum  a microphone on the other side we have the volume  buttons and the power button and at the bottom we  get the sim card slot tray we get another hole for  microphone the usbc charging port and the holes  for the second speakers so they both have two  speakers one at the bottom here and one at the top  on each device and funny enough the a535g sounds  better and louder than the samsung galaxy s22 and  i'm also going to show you a quick example just so  you can um hear how they sound and another thing  that i want to mention with the a535g can actually  install an sd card to the s22 you cannot install  an sd card so let me show you that quick test so  you can see how the speakers sound on both devicesi was lostmoving on to performance well here you're gonna  notice quite a bit of a difference and that makes  sense because the s22 is a flagship the most  powerful device that samsung makes for 2022  so inside this we have the exynos 2200 this is  the european version of this device and inside  the a535g we have the exynos 1280 and i have some  screenshots here of the scores that we get on the  antutu benchmark so a really big difference  for this course so 880 000 versus 367 000  and this is the score that  we get on the geekbench five  so again a big difference for the multi-core  score here so 3 500 versus about 1800 now  you're not gonna notice that big of a difference  in actual usage unfortunately so even though we  get these super high scores it's not like the  s22 will be three times faster than the a53  no and i also have to mention that both devices  are quite buggy so the s22 constantly freezes  the a53 constantly freezes this is probably the  worst tier that samsung had for the ui so both  devices even though this one is much much faster  they constantly freeze they constantly lag so i  can't really say that this one is so much better  than the a53 no they're both quite laggy actually  there is also quite a bit of a difference for the  speed for the internal storage so both devices  have 128 gigs of internal storage and again i took  a screenshot of the reading and writing speeds for  the internal storage and here once again a massive  massive difference from the cheaper a53 to the  samsung galaxy s22 so eventually when samsung will  actually push some updates and make these phones  better not as laggy as they are right now the  s22 should be much faster and much easier to use  basically will give you a better experience  overall not currently because they both are  quite laggy but eventually the s22 does have the  harder to make this phone super quick super fast  when compared to the a53 and just in case you're  wondering yes you can actually watch netflix in hd  on both devices let me just open this here  scroll the bottom here so we have the same  security level on both devices so yes you will  be able to watch netflix in hd on both devices  now moving on to cameras so the camera systems  on their backs are a bit different i'm actually  working on a full camera comparison video between  the a53 and the s22 unfortunately we haven't had  the best weather over the past few days so  i'm still kind of waiting for a sunny day so  i can actually finish the daytime pictures and  daytime videos so i can complete that video so  for now i'm not gonna include any sample  pictures or videos but hopefully by the end  of the day or early tomorrow i can actually show  you that camera comparison in between the two but  basically would the a5352 get an extra camera  well in a way we have a macro camera another  camera use them for portrait mode pictures where  on the back of the s22 we do get a telephoto lens  camera so of course the camera setup on the  s22 is better the s22 can also record at higher  resolution so it can do eight head 24 frames per  second where the maximum recording resolution  for the a535g is 4k 30 frames per second with the  main camera the ultra white camera and even with  the selfie camera and as i said as i said as soon  as i finish that camera comparison i will add the  link in the video's description or the top right  corner so you can see some examples for pictures  and videos in more situations basically but for  now i don't have that ready now just to give you  an example how they both open some apps i'm just  going to open a couple of apps here that i have  on the home screen so there isn't that big of  a difference even though the s22 is supposed to  be the much faster device out of the two so not a  crazy crazy difference of course the s12 is a bit  faster but you're actually not gonna notice that  even for games i've noticed that you can't really  tell the difference if i'm playing games on  this one or on the s22 i guess having an antutu  benchmark score of over 300 000 is kind of good  enough for most um applications and games these  days so not a massive difference in performance  as the benchmark results um would suggest  so there you have it this is the cheaper samsung  galaxy a53 basically you can buy two a53s for  the price of a samsung galaxy s22 so is it  worth spending double the money on the s22  i'm not sure if um it is actually because  as i said this one is not slow by any means  it does look quite good as well and you're also  gonna see that camera comparison and see how  good those cameras on the back of the a53 are  when compared the cameras on the s22 all right  guys hopefully this video was useful thanks  for watching and i'll see you in the next one
YE2zsF9P47Y,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- Oh boy, what's up guys?I am so excited,because the Samsung event just ended.Well today, depending upon when you're watching this,which means, my friends, we have new devices in hand.I would say in studio,but I'm actually in my sister's basementbecause I'm on the East Coast right now.I am so excited about thisbecause I obviously love testing out new phonesand today we have got the Samsung Galaxy S22+and the brand new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.I'm gonna put some links in the description.If you guys want to get any of the phones,that I'm talking about today, these are affiliate links.So if you do use those,just know that you are helping me out and my channel.You might hear some stomping feet upstairs,that is the sound of a two year oldjust making her way around the house.So the first thing that we're gonna unbox,is the Samsung Galaxy S22+, there are two versions of this.There's the S22+, which is the larger displayand the S22, which is a little bit smaller of a display.So this one we're gonna open it firstbecause this is the gold pink color.And when I saw this during the announcementI was like, oh, beautiful!So let's see what it looks like in person.So here's the unboxing, it's very simple.Now that nothing really comes in the boxes anymore.It's like, basically like, here's the phone,good luck have fun.Oh, we do have SIM card ejector, just quite a treat.Wow, this color is really, really pretty.So like I said, there are two version of the S22,the S22 and the S22+.They both have an internal storage optionof 128 and 256 gigs,both running Snapdragon 8 Gen 1,both with eight gigs of RAM.They each have three rear cameras,a 50 megapixel wide, a 12 megapixel ultra wide,a 10 megapixel telephoto with 3X optical zoomand the front facing camera is 10 megapixels.The smaller S22 has a 3,700 milliamp hour batterywith a 6.1 inch display.Whereas the S22+ has a 4,500 milliamp hour batteryand a 6.6 inch display.These come in the phantom black,phantom white, green, pink goldand there are some Samsung exclusive colors,graphite, cream, sky blue and violet.And I think this pink gold might be my favorite.Are we surprised?No, we're not.Since we're doing an unboxing,we might as well see what we've gotten here.We've got USB-C to USB-C cableand a lovely little piece of paper.Where's my Ultra?Where's the Ultra?How is this an unboxing with no lid?What have I done? Oh gosh.Okay, well the lid has fallen off,so no, it's not the lid,this is the bottom of the box. (laughing)So I don't know which color this one is.We're gonna find out.Oh, it's look, it's a fantom black, look at that.Okay, we gotta take the sticker off.Okay, we got a front sticker too.Ready? Front sticker, front sticker, get into it.So satisfying.It's actually so strange going from the S21 Ultrabecause the S21 had such a huge camera bump.Whereas this, it's just like the lensesare kinda popping up.So there's no actual bump on the S22.So you guys can see like, it's crazycause it's like, it's not there.I think I like it.I'm not really sure.I'm kind of, I'm a little indifferent about it.Did like the camera bump,cause it really did sort of set it apartand it kinda separated from the phone.Maybe I do like this more.I'm not sure.I'll get back to you in the full review.I do like that, it's all very seamless.So it feels very, very clean.So the S22 Ultra has a,6.8 inch Edge QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display,with a refresh rate between 1 and 120 Hertz.It has four rear cameras.There's an ultra wide, a wide, two telephoto lensesand a front facing 40 megapixel camera.It has a 5,000 milliamp battery lifeand there's four colors that you can choose from.There's fantom black, white, green and burgundy.They do have some online, exclusive colors.There's a graphite, a redand the sky blue that one's actually, it's pretty nice.One thing that I'm most excitedto test out on this is the Nightography.So this is a new feature where of course it's using AI.I feel like the AI buzzwords,is this two words, artificial intelligence.You know what I mean.It has been tossed around so muchover the past couple of years.Like what does that actually mean?Well, in this case, in the presentationthey were showing how it takes a bunchof photos and then it goes inand determines which photos look the best.If there's some blurry or shaky onesthose are then removedand then all of those photos are kinda merged togetherto make one solid still and crisp image.That's gonna be something,that is definitely high on the list to test off, test out.Who is reading this? (giggling)Which is how to power off your phone.I can't do two things at once.I don't, I just, it's impossible.Another thing that I'm excited to test out isin their portrait videography, portrait photo for video,you can now kinda shift the focusand that's gonna be kinda interestingand I feel like that's kinda rivalingthe iPhone 13's Cinematic Mode.Which I'm not gonna lie to you.I don't think I've ever usedsince I did my review of the iPhone.Now that I'm thinking about it.They've also improved the portrait mode.They also showed this really cool demo of,I know for a fact that if any of youhave ever used portrait mode.If you're holding somethingor it's like the example that they showed was,this girl had a straw on her drink.Then the straw goes out of focusor whatever your holding kinda goes outta focus.So with this, it's being able to detect,what should actually be in focus.Like, if you're holding something,that is a part of the image,that is a part of your body right now,that should say in focus.So I'm very excited to also test that out.I feel like there's so many small little updatesthat may seem kind of insignificant,but in the grand scheme of things,like these small little updatesto video and photo are actually a pretty big deal.Another thing is the new S Pen.So this new S Pen is supposedto have 70% improved accuracy over the S21,which is kind of excitingbecause it really is so interesting,like, trying to use these pensand then having them not be as responsive as possibleand I think Samsung is actually donea pretty good job with that.So I'm added to the list.Another thing that Justine is excitedto try out on the new devices.So here they are both next to each other.The S22 definitely has a much more rounded kind of look,where the S22 Ultra kind of, it's a little more boxy.With this new S22 Ultraand of course the advancements in the S Pen.This has a very Note-ish feel.I mean, this basically feels like a notebut it's not a note, but it might as well be a note.Like what is a note?I don't even know anymore (laughing).If you guys haven't already be sure to subscribebecause I'm gonna be doing a follow up reviewon both of these devices.They may be in one single video.They may be in separate videos.Let me know what you guys would prefer.And if you're interested in getting any of these devices,again, I put some affiliate links in the description below.So be sure to go check those out.If you are looking to get one of these devicesand with that, my friends, I will see you in the next video.(upbeat music)Samsung Galaxy--- [Jessy] (babbling) Galaxy.- S22 Ultra.- [Jessy] (babbling) Ultra.- Do you wanna show them the other phone?Look, hold it up in the air. - [Jessy] Yes, please.- That's Jessy's, hold up, show 'em.There you go, nice, nice.Good job, keep holding it up.There you go. - [Jessy] So nice.- [woman] Yeah, now it's Jessy's.- That's nice, keep holding it up.You gotta show it to 'em.Okay."
wv8-8y0XMTE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,i'm gonna do this review of the s22ultra a little bit different becausethere is so much to cover so instead oftelling you the specs i will talk aboutmy experiences with the phone while ishow you the specs on screen and you canskip to the specific chapter that youwant to watch using the chapter markersin the video i have worked so hard toput this review together i have spent asolid month and a half playing with thenew samsung galaxy s22 ultra i stilldon't think this is the perfect androidphone it's closed but it's not quitethere there's a few hiccups that i didexperience but overall i'm not hypercritical and i'm not feeling hypercritical and i do love it overall sothis is a great phone now if you're likeme and you like android reviews andtutorials subscribe for more and a bigshout out to my newest s'mores ben amberand ray thank you so much for thesupport and for making this videopossible via patreon and buy me a coffeeso i bought this phone for about 250after my 700 trading credit for my s21ultra which i reviewed last year i alsohad the samsung shop app 7.5discount and i did have some rewardsthat i had also racked up to redeem bythe way if you like discounts i do havea pretty sweet discount code it's fivepercent off for any new samsungcustomers so hit up my referral link inthe coupon code down below you can evenuse that on samsung's website for stufflike tvs and appliances or whatever soyou can definitely save some really goodmoney so normally this phone retails for1199.99and it goes up to1599.99 for the one terabyte model i amstarting to see some discounts on itthough so don't pay full price when youdon't have to the pre-order process forthis phone was a freaking headachebecause one the shop app was notautomatically adding the 7.5discount like it should have and that'sa 50 difference so i definitely wantedthat discount and two the checkoutscreen was constantly removing items orthrowing up errors or saying things wereout of stock and then back in stock itmade me feel like samsung did not wantmy money and i hope that they fix thoseproblems for future major releasesbecause i almost just didn't buy one atall the major reason i bought it was toreview it but if i did not have this jobif i didn't need one for a review iwould have just said f it and given upso the one i have here in hand is thephantom white color and yes that is asticker covering up my imei i don't knowwhy they print the imei on the back ofsamsung phones but they do so i'mcovering it up with a sticker it isavailable in a slew of other colors aswell on their website none of themreally piqued my interest except forthis white color so i went with the onethat would complement my usual choicesof accessories disappointingly theviolet and the pink gold colors are onlyavailable for the smaller phone modelsnow hopefully one day we will startseeing some more diversity in terms ofcolor choices for the top tier flagshipultra phones instead of just your basicslike white black blue green and redwhich is what we usually would see noweven though it's not crazy shiny thedesign is corning gorilla glass victison the back but it's matte and it has akind of soft touch to it and it looksreally velvety smoothit doesn't pick up fingerprints or oilsfrom your hands so it keeps it lookingreally nice and newbut the frame is aluminum and it doespick up fingerprints really easily youcan see how shiny it is in the videoalso you can immediately tell that thisthing is a rectangle the corners are notsuper curved though the displayis definitely curved but that means thatyou have these really angular edges thatcan make it kind of annoying to holdbecause it's going to dig into your palmlike it is right now this is how inaturally hold my phone and i did noticethat this corner would dig into my palmquite often now i did add a case this isthe velvet caviar case it does add alittle bit of curvature and a little bitof softness to that edge and that doeshelp whenever i'm holding it but it isstill a big phone so keep that in mindit's larger than my pixel 6 pro it'salso on the heavier side of phones it'sa little over 8 ounces i hate theplacement of this one speaker on thebottom it's on the left side so thatalso means my palm often covers it upthe second speaker is at the top of thephone and that one fires forward portplacement is generally the same asprevious gens not much to say there itis still ip68 so i was able to use thisat the top of a ski slope while it wassnowing and i was not worried aboutgetting snow into the ports the coolthing about this design is even thoughthe s21 ultra supported an s pen whichwas nice it was not built in so it wasnot easily accessible day to day unlessyou bought a bulky case for it but onthe other hand the s22 ultra does havethe s pen built in and it's also ip68now the s pen is so much fun to use andit actually has a very similar gui asother phones with the s pen capabilitiesso if you've already used a fold or thes21 ultra or the previous notegenerations then you will already knowhow to use the s pen it's quite easy youcan easily click it in and out of itsport to use it it has a built-in batterywhich you will likely never run low andit will make noise and vibrate if youhappen to leave it behind like if you'releaving a coffee shop you take yourphone but you leave this on the desk itwill make noise for you so that you knowthat you left it behind i like that ican use it to write out text it alsomakes video and photo editing reallyprecise in apps like adobe rush or mixand i love the display it is reallyreally beautiful on this phone they dida great job it is super bright outsidewhich makes it very easy to see on asunny day it also gets quite dim fornight time use the display is big thoughso it's kind of bulky for one-handed usebut there is a one-handed mode in caseyou prefer to use it that way if i jumpfrom my iphone 12 pro max to this phonethe s22 ultra is so fast it really showsoff its high refresh rate and it issuper smooth watching hdr content onhere on netflix looks beautiful and itis easy for me to critique my owncontent creation on the screen becauseit is high quality and it is a largescreen so it's easy for me to find anykind of errors as i'm using photoshop oradobe rush for my videos now all ofthose super fun customizations like theborder actions for the always-onnotification screen those are all thereas expected and that also makes usingthe samsung one ui a very uniqueexperience compared to other androidphones it does come with android 12 withone ui4 and since release it has hadseveral different updates to the googleplay system the operating system as wellas security patches so if you're justnow buying one make sure to check outall those updates because i'm sure thatthere's going to be some availablecoming from android 12 on pixel thesamsung software is a bit annoying andthat's just a personal taste for myselffor example i turn off samsung pay whenyou swipe up because i prefer to swipeup to get to my home screen whenever i'min an app i also prefer swiping up toget to my app drawer as well so i i justturned off and disabled samsung pay idislike bixby and generally i never useit so i immediately switch everythingthat i can to google's assistant i alsoprefer google news whenever i swipe overfrom the left side over samsung freewhich i don't like as much i don't feellike samsung free is as good atunderstanding what i want to see andproviding me the kind of content that iwould prefer so there is lots to editlots to customize lots of time in thesystem settings to ensure that the phoneis set up with my preferences the edgepanels over on the side are fun to usethey make quickly accessing apps supereasy one of my main critiques though iswith the operating system in generalit's a fast phone with this upgradedqualcomm snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor italso has 12 gigs of ram if you get the256 gig model but sometimes apps stillcrash like instagram randomly closed onme one day while i was posting a photoand then i had to re-edit the entireprocess of posting that photo the camerashutter speed is pretty slow so it'sincredibly tough to get a decent photoof my dog whenever i'm using the generalauto settings in the camera app now ican hold down the shutter button to takea burst of photos and i generally haveto switch to that if i'm planning totake pictures of my pets i don't do alot of mobile gaming but to test thegraphical rendering and power i did run3d mark tests and i got great results atthe very top of the list when comparedto other phones on the market theultrasonic fingerprint sensor is reallyreally good it's fast it's efficient itworks every time i don't have a screenprotector on here so i will test it moreonce i do install one because i dointend to it is much much better thanthe sensor in the pixel 6 screen and ifyou do want a deep dive into thedifferences and why i love ultrasonicbecause i definitely do check out myvideo all about security and reliabilityof different kinds of sensors which islinked should be right up therehopefully i remember to put it up thereif not it's in the description downbelow as well they also have 2d facelock which as you can see i did not justuse my fingerprint i just unlocked itwith 2d face lock it's quite quick soit's really easy to unlock your phonewith the face unlock that's included inthe front facing camera it's also fastand reliable and super useful wheneveri'm gonna give that example of skiingagain i was at the top of a ski slopeand i was wearing gloves we still havesnow in the mountains and here's yourproof i did take a picture it was reallycool the audio from the speakers couldbe better i listen to a lot of youtubevideos podcasts music while i work in mystudio i immediately noticed that thepixel 6 pro has way more bass and a muchmore fuller sound than the s22 ultra'sspeakers the s22 ultra sounds kind oftinny and flat it does come with dolbyatmos built in and you can find that inthe settings and you can mess aroundwith your equalizer settings to make itsound better but out of the box though idefinitely feel like most userswon't even realize that those optionsare there or they won't want to messaround with that they will just leave itas default i also noticed that thelevels were different between the twospeakers with the bottom one beinglouder than the top one obviously thereis no headphone jack there never isthese days but bluetooth 5.2 isexcellent and i had no issues connectingor listening to music or calling peoplewhenever i was using my samsung galaxyearbuds now one perk that i continue tolove with the samsung phones is the factthat i can use wireless powershare likeprevious gens to charge my wirelessearbuds on the back of the phone it alsosupports fast wireless charging 2.0 viathe wpc certified wireless chargingwhich also works with chi so this willwork on any qi chargers that you wantshould you buy a 45 wattwired charger for this phone i would sayprobably not if you watched mycomparison between this and the s21ultra you know that the difference inthe speed of charging between 45 wattadapters and something lower like 25watt adapters is honestly really minimalit's only a few minutes sothat difference does not make the costjustified in my opinion if you wanted tobuy a faster charger but the batterylasts a really good long time for me ican easily use this phone all daywithout putting it on the charger andthat's a huge thing for me as well nowlet's talk about 5git is great obviously this will varydepending on your location physicalbarriers your cell carrier of choice butthese are my speeds here in downtowndenver and that's quite adequate andlastly let's talk about these cameras onthe back here all of these beautifulcameras so here are the specs for theback lenses feel free to pause the videoif you want to read all of them at yourown pacesamsung does a great job with their zoomquality with the super zoom that can goup to 100 times digitally 10 timesoptical so for example there's thistp-link router which i totally did nothack at this coffee shop even thoughit's just sitting out where anybody canpick it up this is going from ultra wideall the way to 100 times zoom now myfriend has an iphone 13 so i comparedthe zoom quality at 15 times which isthe highest that he could go in zoom onhis iphone to my s22 ultra at 15 timeszoom and the s22 ultra is so much moreclear so much more easy to read tryingto take a photo of the mountains thoughwith zoom still amounts in a very grainypotato of a photo but something withstriking contrast like this router withits black text seems much easier for thephone to compute and generate a cleanerphoto samsung definitely made upgradesto their aperture and the sensors sonighttime photos are better but stillnot as good as my pixel they are stillsomewhat dark and grainy ultra wide isgreat but it does have some lensdistortion around the edges it has thatfishbowl thing going on whenever you'retaking photos of a flat surface it'sdefinitely noticeable i love all the funlittle camera app features like portraitphotography and food photography ireally had a lot of fun with the foodphotography the food settings give yousome really beautiful photos ofof well your food you get vibrant colorsyou get clear beautiful bokeh around theedges of the frame i would say it's veryartsy portraits are kind of hit or missi find myself rarely choosing theportrait mode over normal mode justbecause half the time the subject cutoutis kind of messyfor regular photos they are very clearthey're really lovely i think the colorslook great though i would say they'remore vibrant than more accurate to reallife i do end up with lots of blurryphotos from the movement of a subject igave that example of taking pictures ofpets earlier the shutter again isnoticeably slower than my pixel that'sdefinitely obvious when you're takingpictures of animals and if anybody outthere has kids you probably can relateto this as well so in this case burstmode would be my huge pro tip becausethis will save you from getting a bunchof disappointing blurry photos thefront-facing camera is very good forselfies and group photos blues in thesky are definitely saturated but if youhave a bunch of backlighting it does agood job of lighting the focus of thephoto as well being able to do a wideangle photo with the front-facing camerais such a blessing when taking groupphotos everybody looks really clearnobody's out of focus the colors aresaturated for sure again i turned offthe beauty mode so i could see howdetailed this lens gets and it's verygood at keeping details like the flyawayhairs next to my face or the littlebubbles in this glass of beer and now iwant a beer so i guess it's a good thingi'm recording this on a friday in termsof videos the portrait video feature isreally cool it did way better than myexpectations so here are some moreexamples of video on the s22 ultra bothfront and back cameras pay closeattention to how the iso auto changesdepending on the lighting and also howthe audio sounds compared to my instudio audio ohit's glitteryoh my gosh that's so cooli found the flowerhow are you my friendhow's it goingokay bye oh yeah you're so cute you aremost precious hi baby helloall right here we have tenten times zoom rocky mountain nationalpark[Applause]my ears are coldestwill you take fear out of the equationoh man there's nothing but bliss baby soall in all i would say this is a lovelyfully fledged flagship phone my mainconcerns with the square design thespeakers those are personal tastes andcritiques not deal killers for everybodyi like the curvature of the display butagain others may not like that theoperating system will hopefully continueto see updates to fix those littlerandom crashes that i've experienced buteven those are somewhat rare and theydon't happen every day so it's generallya very very good experience having the spen is such a blessing as a contentcreator it makes accuracy of my edits somuch easier and so much faster so i haveto say i love this phone it's definitelygoing to be a contender for my favoritephone of 2022 and if you want a flagshipyou should consider this one
RAzhE5VSfgU,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- After using the S22 Ultra for six months,I wanted to talk to youabout the good things, the bad things.And then also give you a few tips to help you get moreout of your phone.Now, this is essentially the S22 ""Note"" Ultraand I'm also gonna put it in contextwith some of its competitors and with the S22+.Fact: Not a lot of people thinkabout the ergonomics of the phone during the buying process.There's a lot of focus on specs and features,but it's important to rememberthat this is a device that you're going to handleand use every day.The S22 Ultra is definitely a larger phone.Now, personally, I think that the curved edge designwhich was borrowed from the Note20 Ultrais very comfortable to use.And because the edges taper in,it's easier for me to grip this phone with one handand there are no sharp edges that dig into my handslike with the iPhone 13 Pro Max.Now at the same time,I think it's really important that if you can,you go to a store and you handle it before you buy one.Go ahead and type on it with one hand, with two hands,play some games, navigate around the home screen,the settings and different apps,and make sure that it's comfortable for you to use.Also, compare the user experiencewith the S22+ and the Z Fold3,which I'll get to in a bit.Now, admittingly, I'm not the most careful userand I've dropped my S22+ a couple of timesduring the past six months,and the Gorilla Glass Victus+on the front and the back have been extremely durable.And the same is true for the new Armor Aluminum frame.So far, I don't have any scratches on the backor any major dings on the frame itself.And I'll revisit this after a full year.I've also had no issues with water or dust so far.So that's not really a long-term concern for me.The one thing that I wanna point outis that the back of the phone is actually quite slippery.So if you plan on using it without a caseand you have a chance to hold it before you buy,I would definitely recommend it.As far as aesthetics,I've said this in some of my other comparisons,but this might be the nicest looking phonethat I've ever used.I absolutely love the shape,the frame, which somehow never picks up fingerprints.And I'm a huge fan of this phantom white color.Although, I have to be honestthat burgundy was a close second for me.Now I'll talk about the display nextbut I love the smaller bezels.And until we have an under-display camerathat can perform as well as this one,I'm absolutely fine with a pinhole camera.And I definitely prefer it to the large notch on the iPhoneor the underwhelming under-display cameraon the Z Fold3.Now, one of the major reasons to get the S22 Ultrais the built-in S Pen.We're now getting nine millisecond latencywhich has been really nice.And even though I'm someonewho only uses it a few times a week,I really appreciate having itand not needing to go look for a tabletin order to mark up or to sign a document.For biometric authentication,we're getting facial recognitionand a very good on-display fingerprint sensor.I have both thumbs programmedand the sensor has worked really great for mein terms of accuracy and speed,even when my hand is wet.And this brings me to the actual displaywhich is insanely good.It's a 6.8-inch display with a resolution of 1440 by 3088.It supports HDR and it has 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate.That means that it can automatically adjustto give you a faster refresh ratefor smoother animation and scrolling.And at the same time,it can lower the refresh rate and save on battery lifewhen you're looking at static content.Now the image quality on this Dynamic AMOLED displayis unbelievably good.So whether you're watching movies,you're binging YouTube videos or playing games,you're going to love this display.It's also extremely bright,about 1,750 nits peak brightness.So that's great when you're outsideor when you're in situationswhere you have to deal with reflections.Now, if you want to enable the brightest possible mode,make sure that you go to settings, display,and then toggle on the settings for extra brightness.Keep in mind that this will use up more batterybut when you need it, it's a great feature to have.And speaking of battery,the S22 Ultra comes with a 5,000 milliampere hour batterywhich has been pretty good.And so far, I get about eight hours of use out of it.Of course, that depends on what I'm doingand the brightness of the display.But for the most part, I finish a typical daywith somewhere between 15 and 30% battery left.And of course, if I'm gonna game for hoursor if I use the GPS a lot,then I do need to charge it during the day.But for how I use the phone,there's rarely a period of more than four to five hourswhere I don't have the opportunity to charge it.If I'm at my desk, then it's sitting on a chargeror if I'm driving, again,it's connected to a wireless charger.So while the S22 Ultra doesn't lastas long as my iPhone 13 Pro Max,I'm happy with the overall battery performance.And we do get a maximum of 45 watts charging.That's not as fast as some of the other phones on the marketbut I can get a full charge in a little bit over an hour.Now, there are a couple of thingsthat you can do to save on battery life.So first you can go to settings, display, screen resolutionand you can lower the resolutionfrom quad HD+ to full HD+.This will slightly reduce the sharpness of the displaybut also reduce battery use.Next, you can extend a battery lifeby limiting the refresh rate to 60 hertzwhich is under settings, display, motion smoothness.Again, you're giving up on smoother scrolling and animationbut you're gaining battery life.Now, personally, I don't do either of thosebecause I'm willing to trade the best user experiencefor potentially having to charge the phone a little bitduring the day.One thing that I recommend that you do,especially if you planon keeping this phone for a long time,is to turn on the protect battery feature.You can find it under settings,battery and device care, more battery settings.Then it will limit the maximum charge to 85%which will extend the lifespan of your battery.And I do have to mention that the S22 Ultradoes not come with a chargerand that's becoming pretty common nowadayswith some of the flagship phones.A little frustrating that a $1,200 phonedoesn't come with a charger at all,let alone one that's capableof the fastest charging speeds that the phone can accept.One feature that I undervalued in the S22 Ultrawhen I first got it is reverse charging.In case you're not familiar with it,you can actually use the S22 Ultrato charge another device.Now I've used it to charge another phonewhen doing a comparison.I've also used it to charge my Galaxy Buds Prowhen I forget to charge them.Another one of the reasonswhy I would recommend looking at the S22 Ultraversus the Fold, the Flip or the S22+ is the camera system.Now this is the best camera systemthat Samsung has to offer.I was already impressed with it at launch.And over the past few months, it has gotten a few updates.And I do wanna mentionthat Samsung is now offering four years of OS updatesand five years of security updates, which is great to see.As far as the camera hardware goes,we're getting 108 megapixel wide camera,a 12 megapixel ultrawideand then two 10 megapixel telephoto cameras,one with a three time optical zoomand one with a 10 time optical zoom.We're also getting a 40 megapixel front facing camera.Now, just as a point of reference,the $1,000 S22+ comes with a 50 megapixel wide,a 12 megapixel ultrawide, a 10 megapixel three time zoomand then a 10 megapixel front facing camera.Now back to the S22 Ultra,this camera system has been very impressive.The image quality is excellentand Samsung took care of some overexposure issueswith an upgrade earlier this year.Now, overall, the images are bright.They have very good dynamic rangeand the HDR processingis able to retain more details in the shadowsand at the same time bring back blown highlights.Now here's a quick comparison with the iPhone 13 Pro Max.And if you wanna see a more detailed comparison,I'll link to that video at the end of this one.Portrait mode has been a bit of a mixed bag here.It does an absolutely fantastic job at edge detectionbut at the same time, you can see that it's fairly harsh.Meaning that when you zoom in,you can see a distinct line where the hair endsand all of the hair is equally in focus.Now, if you shot this with the DSLR,there would be more of a natural fall offfrom the focus plane, which is her eyes.Now, of course, having a three and a 10 time optical zoommeans that you're able to get closer to the subjectwithout losing image quality.And you can zoom up to a hundred times,but that's digital zoom,which does come with the noticeable loss in quality.Still when I'm far away from a subjectand I don't have the option of getting closer,it's better to have digital zoom than nothing at all.Now the front facing camera on the S22 Ultrais also very impressive.40 megapixels is a very high resolutionand the images are sharp and extremely detailed.Now this goes back to where I saidthat I would rather have better overall image qualitywith a pinhole camera than an under-display camerawith poor quality.And night photos were also extremely impressiveon this phone.Handheld shots came out greatand actually it looked brighter than real lifewhich could be a pro or a con, depending on your preference.Now, switching to video, the S22 Ultra did a fantastic job.The image quality and stabilizationof handheld video were excellent.And you can see that even as I chase Mac around,the video is very stableand the exposure remains fairly constant.The S22 Ultra also has some great built-in featuresif you want to move beyond basic point and shoot.You have options like pro photo and pro videowhich give you full control over the camera.There's slow motion and super slow motion.And then one of my favorite features, director's view.This lets you previewwhat each of the cameras sees in real time.And then you can switch between them while you're recording.Now, if you're a content creator,this is a fantastic feature.And even if you're not, you can record special momentswhile at the same time capture your reaction to them.From a performance standpoint, here are quick benchmarksof the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipbut I really want to focus on real-life use.This phone has plenty of processing power.It comes with eight gigs of RAMif you buy 128 gigabytes of storageand then anything between 256 gigabytesand one terabytes comes with 12 gigs of RAM.One thing to keep in mind is that the S22 Ultradoes not come with a micro SD card slot.So make sure that you get as much internal storageas you need for the apps and the games that you want.There was some controversywith Samsung throttling performancewith the game optimizing servicewhen you're playing games, but not during benchmarkswhich has been done before by other companiesand is definitely deceiving.At the same time,the fact that you can now disable this featureisn't necessarily something that matters long term.Like, sure, the games will run at higher FPSfor a few minutes,but without this sort of preemptive throttlingor any form of active cooling,the chip will get hot within a few minutes.And then we'll still throttle back performancein order to protect itself.What I hope to see in the futureis manufacturers focusing on sustained performanceon thermal management and on battery liferather than trying to achievethe highest peak performance.But that's a topic for another video.Now, gaming has been very good on the S22 Ultra.I love the big display.The AKG-tuned speakers are excellent.And when playing PUBG, I could go up to HDR for graphicswith extreme frame rate or ultra HD for graphicswith ultra for frame rate.Now the speakers are also great when you're watching contentand they do support Dolby Atmos.And to be fair, when I'm playing games,I'm always wearing headphones.I also stream games with the Xbox Game Pass app,and this worked really wellboth with an Xbox controller or with my new Razer Kishi V2.And as far as the operating system,Android 12 and One UI 4.1 has been very responsive.It's been fluid,and I love being able to customize it for my specific needs.We're also able to run two apps side by sideor one on top of the other,which is actually pretty manageablewith the display this size.Now, finally, if you want to drive moreof a desktop-like user experience,you can reboot and DeX,connect to keyboard and mouse and an external display,and then get to work.Now, another area where I'm happyto see Samsung continue to develop is their ecosystem.A Galaxy devices continue to improve with featureslike auto switching with a Galaxy Buds Pro,app continuity across devices,tablet keyboard sharing with your phoneand a shared clipboardfor copying and pasting across devices.So it's great to see that Samsungcontinues to shrink the gap with Apple's ecosystem.Now you should see how the S22 Ultracompares with the iPhone 13 Pro Max.Hopefully this video is helpful.Click on my face to subscribe.You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice.Good luck and see you soon."
4_9tNlwnj6Q,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"The Galaxy S22 Ultra is Samsung’s flagship in the S22 Series and was launched alongsidethe Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+.The highlight of the Galaxy S22 Ultra is its support for an S Pen stylus, which thus far,has been exclusive to the Galaxy Note series.It is powered by the top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC and runs Samsung’sOne UI 4.1 on top of Android 12.Today I’m gonna break down this review into things that I like about the Galaxy S22 Ultra,and things I wish were better.Let’s beginIs this a Galaxy S series phone or is it a Galaxy Note?Well, it is a bit of both.The Galaxy S22 Ultra looks different from its S22 and S22+ siblings.The design is inspired by the Galaxy Note series and things such as the big displaywith curved sides but flat top and bottom are all reminiscent of the Galaxy Note 20 UltraThe Galaxy S22 Ultra has an aluminium frame that feels premium and Corning Gorilla GlassVictus+ on the front and back.The S Pen stylus sits in its own silo and can be pulled out whenever you need to ‘Note’ something.The Galaxy S22 Ultra and the S Pen are both IP68 rated for dust and water resistanceThe Galaxy S22 Ultra is made for media consumption.The display is stunning and has excellent viewing angles.You can see content clearly even under direct sunlight.The high refresh rate makes scrolling buttery smooth.The Galaxy S22 Ultra also has stereo speakers with support for Dolby Atmos.The crisp AMOLED display and the stereo speakers really make for great video watching and gaming experiences.Speaking of gaming, let's talk about the performance of the Galaxy S22 Ultra.Samsung usually uses its home-grown Exynos SoCs for its flagship smartphones in India,but the Galaxy S22 Ultra is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC.This is the most powerful SoC you can get in an Android smartphone right now.That’s not all, you get 12GB of RAM and this phone can use up to 8GB of storage asadditional RAM.The result is absolute domination when it comes to gaming.I played Asphalt 9 Legends and Call of Duty Mobile at the highest settings, and the GalaxyS22 Ultra ran them without any hint of lag or stutter.General performance was snappy and power users are going to love using this phone.Samsung ships the Galaxy S22 Ultra with One UI 4.1, based on Android 12.The UI is polished and feels intuitive.I never had to spend too much time finding the right setting.Samsung now offers four years of OS upgrades and five years of security updates for thisphone which should keep it relevant for quite some time.The S Pen is also convenient.You can easily take notes with it, use it to multitask, and even use it as a remotefor the cameras.Speaking of cameras, the Galaxy S22 Ultra has a versatile quad-camera setupFor selfies, It has a 40-megapixel camera in the tiny hole at the front.The ‘Space Zoom’ feature lets you zoom in all the way to 100X, so you can capturefaraway objects with ease.The camera software helps stabilise the frame to help you get your shot without blur.Daylight shots taken with the primary camera had very good dynamic range.The ultra-wide-angle camera offered a wider field of view but there was a slight dip indetails which was evident after magnifying shots . I enjoyed taking close-ups with theGalaxy S22 Ultra as it captured detailed photos every single time.I’ll leave you with a few more photos, check them out.Low-light camera performance was good enough to be shared on social media, and there wasno need to switch to a dedicated night mode.Shots really are that good.Night mode helps enhance detail in darker areas of the frame, which is useful if youwant the absolute best looking photo in low light.Selfies are pixel-binned to 10-megapixel resolution and these showed good results in daylightas well as low light.Video recording was also impressive, and the phone could shoot at up to 8K with the primarycamera.Videos were stabilised well and had accurate colours during the day, and at night.The Galaxy S22 Ultra was able to deliver a day and a half’s worth of runtime with myusage.In our HD video loop test, the phone managed to go on for 16 hours and 21 minutes whichis decent.The Galaxy S22 Ultra does a lot of things quite well and did manage to impress me withits performance, however there are a few things that I wish it did better.To start with, this is a big and bulky phone!Just look at it.You would be more comfortable using it with two hands instead of trying to shuffle itaround in one.It tips the scales at 228g.While performance is one of the strengths of the Galaxy S22 Ultra, it comes at a cost.Push it to its limits and it starts to get warm.Extended gaming sessions and continuous camera usage make this phone heat up.While the Galaxy S22 Ultra is capable of 45W charging, it does not come with a chargerin the box.Samsung only provides a USB Type-C to Type-C cable, and you’ll need to purchase Samsung’s45W charger separately,The Galaxy S22 Ultra is extremely expensive.The base variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is priced at 1,09,999 in Indiawhile the other variant with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is priced at Rs, 1,18,999.The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra brings together the camera capabilities of the Galaxy S seriesand the S Pen functionality of the Galaxy Note series.This should help the Galaxy S22 Ultra appeal to a wide audience.Since current competing smartphones do not have features such as 100X Space Zoom andthe S Pen, the Galaxy S22 Ultra is pretty much unopposed.If you don’t mind its high price, the Galaxy S22 Ultra is definitely one of the best Androidsmartphones in the market at the moment."
1asmo3_-2AM,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"The Galaxy S22 Ultra is finally here and I've spent the past weekwith this phone and I have a lot of things to share with you.The Galaxy S22 Ultra is literally a Noteseries of smartphone, but it's just called and S series of smartphone right now.So without further ado, let's begin with our in-depthreview today.review today.So the Galaxy S22Ultra that we have here in Malaysia comes with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset.And this is the first time that we Malaysians are gettingthe Snapdragon version on the Galaxy S series of smartphones.But I think it's quite disappointing too, since the Exynos 2100last year on the Galaxy S21 Ultra was much better thanthe Snapdragon 888 in terms of efficiency and the Exynos 2200 this year comeswith an AMD GPU which we don't get to try out this year unfortunately.But enough of that we are reviewing the Galaxy S22Ultra today and we'll go across our usual six points when it comes to a smartphoneto streamline this review and not to go off on a tangent for a very long time.We are going to focus mainly on the Galaxy S22 alone.We will have more future videos where you go in-depth in a few certainaspects, so subscribe if you don't want to miss out on those videos.Also, this entire video is scripted, edited,uploaded, and published by me alone.It is not paid by anyone or seen by anyone else before this video is published.Let's start off with the box of the Galaxy S22 Ultra right here.I know that this box is smaller than last year's GalaxyS21 Ultra and this is also mentioned by Samsung as well.However, I didn't expect this box to be so much smaller.Of course, a box that is this thin means that there is no charger inside,just like last year as well.I mean, we are kind of accustomed to this already, right?Check out our quick unboxing of the Galaxy S22 Ultra at the top right corner there.And then we got to talk about the design of the brand new Galaxy S22 Ultra.This design is something they grew on me.Initially, I prefer the Galaxy S21 Ultra Design.Instead of hiding the camera bump Samsungjust embrace the camera bump and also made it look pretty at the same time.But when I look at the brand new Galaxy S22 Ultra with my owneyes, Samsung made that bump elegant now.It's just 5 circles and that's it.Plus, because of how the camera circles are positioned, the phone doesn'trock as much on the table compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultrawhen they are both without a case That's a nice side effect, actually.Also, the entire back of the phone is covered by a very nice mattefinish material and it is also available in a total of four different colors.So we have the usual phantom black, phantom white,and then we also have the new burgundy and also green color.I saw a lot of polls on Twitter to vote for.Which color is your favorite and I saw a lot more peoplegoing for either burgundy or the green color.Personally speaking though, I'll go for green color.While it does have the name green in the nameMany people just looked at it for the first time and say, Oh, it's actually blueand I get it because that hue is very similarto the Galaxy S10 series with the PRISM Green Color.Again, it's just called green, but it looks very blueand I love that PRISM Green color too.And combined with this matte finish, it just looks and feels really good.Even the sides of the phone is also very elegant.And in this roundup of various movie,both the front and the back pieces of glass come into the frameand I find this kind of craftsmanship to be just insanely good.Plus, the top and bottom of the phone are also flat as well,which is again reminiscent of the Galaxy Note series.Of Smartphones.And also the entire back in front of the phone are covered byCorning, Gorilla Glass Victus+, by the way.And since we're here, let's move on and talk about the screen on this phone.It has a massive 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2Xdisplay with up to 120 Hertz refresh rate and also down to 1 Hertz to save batteryand it also has a resolution of 3088 by 1440 pixels.On paper, it doesn't sound like much, but in truth this display actually gota big upgrade in terms of both brightness and also color accuracy.When we whipped out our colorimeter to test its color accuracy,I had to adjust its brightness to the maximum to see how much it actually goes.And I saw 368 nits average when it is at maximum brightness.And that wasn't really that impressive.And then I realizedthere is another button in the settings menu called Extra Brightness.I turned that optionon, cranked up the brightness to 100% and I was immediately blinded.The Galaxy S22 Ultra went beyond 750 nits of brightness.The Galaxy S21 Ultra doesn't even have this extra brightness option, by the way.And yet the Galaxy S22 Ultra manages to achieveevery single brightness level with the perfect white point.That is to say, all the adobe outputvalues are exactly the same while viewing white color.Also, Samsung has this feature called Extra Dim, where its brightness can goreally low, which is perfect for viewing the screen in complete darkness.And then we dialled the brightness back to 100 nits, which is typicallywhat we use indoors and continue with the color accuracy tests.We got nearly 100% coverage for both sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts,and the Delta E value is also very low as well.Oh, I should have mentioned that.I also did not change any color profiles in the settings menu.I just got the phone and I immediately did this color test.Of course you can use the magnificent screen to view magnificentphotos and videos taken on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.This one comeswith a total of five different cameras, each serving its own purpose.The camera setup is very similar to the Galaxy S21 Ultra,but we are leaving the camera comparisons between these two phonesfor another video in the future focusing on the Galaxy S22Ultra itself I took a bunch of photosand it's one of those phones that I don't have to worry about.A photo turning out bad if I forgot to tap to focus before taking a shot,for example, and all of the pictures shown here are taken on a super gloomy day.And it already started to rain when I was about to take pictures with this phone.The wind was blowing very strongly to the point that my hands couldn'tstay still, but the OIS and the software in the Galaxy S22Ultra managed to stabilize all of the shots.I honestly just use the Galaxy S22 Ultra to takea bunch of photos both indoors and outdoors,and I enjoyed every moment of it so much so that I don't even rememberwhich zoom level was used to take these pictures.I do remembersome of the pictures of these dogs were taken using portrait mode, though.And of course, one big highlight this time around is the night shots.Samsung made a big deal out of it and we tested it out too.And I was immediately impressed.The pictures have clearly gone through some algorithm to clean it up,but it's still looks very authentic and it's clearly a night shot.And yet we still have a much on Expert RAW app which offers a lot more controlto take pictures, with professional tools to avoid going off on a tangent.We will leave that for yet another video too and for video side of things.Samsung also said that the stabilization has improvedso I shot a video in 4K 60 fps of me walking acrossa very bumpy path during broad daylight and it looks good.So no surprises there.And then when the night fell, I took the same test again.And yes, it does have some post-processing artifactwhen it comes to the stabilization, but it still looks very good.The noise level is surprisingly little,but this is not the end of our camera tests of the Galaxy S22 Ultra.We have shot the same pictures and videos we have the Galaxy S21 Ultrathat we have here, so we have another comparison video coming soon.So please subscribe now.Moving on to the performance side, of things, the Galaxy S22Ultra that we have here in Malaysia and what we've mentionedcomes with the Snapdragon chipset, namely the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.Like what we've mentioned in our performance tests,even though it is thermally throttled and games are rendered at a lower resolution,the frame ratecoming out of it is actually pretty good and it definitely didn't overheatas the surface temperature is always below 40 degrees Celsius.I mean, this one isn't even made for gaming.So the more throttling to maintain a comfortable userexperience is understandable.I just wish that there is an option for us to tap on it and make it go full blast.Still, I want to know how the Exynos 2200 with the AMD GPU performs,but it only seems to be available in Europe right now. Hmm.Now, moving on tothe battery life of this Galaxy S22 Ultra.I'm impressed that Samsung managed to fit in a 5000 mAh batterydespite having to sacrifice some space to fit the S Pen inside the phone.I can provide our usual battery life test resultslike what we do here, but that doesn't really make much sense.So I'm just going to spoil the comparison between this phone and the GalaxyS21Ultra with the Exynos 2100 when it comes to the battery life tests.I calibrated the Galaxy S21 Ultra with the Exynos2100 Galaxy S22 Ultra with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.Both of these phones at 100 nits of brightness, adaptive framerate, 1440p resolution, and connected both of these phones to WiFi.Both phones ran the PCMark 10 battery life tests sideby side and I even filmed this time lapse just for you to see.The result is astonishing yet quite perplexing.The Galaxy S21 ultra which had gone througha lot of charge cycles since it was my daily driver for the firsteight months of the year 2021 and it also had a SIM card insidewhile having both Facebook Messenger and Telegram running in the background.Yet somehow with the Galaxy S21 Ultra that I have personally daily drivenfor eight months manages to outperform the brand newGalaxy S22 Ultra in our battery life test.This could be caused by a few reasons.Either the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is inefficientor the optimizations for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 - and subsequentlythe Galaxy S22 Ultra is just not that good yet.Either way, there's a noticeable gap when it comes to the battery life tests,but that's not really a big deal since they are both having a 5000mAh battery and it can definitely go through myone day of intense usage without much of an issue.As for the charging time, we use our Ugreen 100W GaN chargerto test out the charging times of the Galaxy S22 Ultra.While Samsung did claim that this phone can support up to 45 watts of wired fastcharging, our wattmeter only report about 28W - which is weird.We don't know why this happens, so we'll leave this mystery for another time.Either way I just leave it to charge and it charged up from 15 to 100% inabout an hour's time which is actually quite fast.And lastly the softwareit comes pre-installed with Android 12 with Samsung's One UI 4.1and it just feels exactly the same like the Galaxy Z Fold3 thatI've got so accustomed to the features available on One UIand my muscle memoryjust make use of all of those features available like Edge Panelwith the screenshot snipping tool, or the Samsung Pay for example.To me they're not bloatware because I use all of these features on a daily basis.I've seen other smartphone brandstry to mimic all of these features, but in a very sloppy manner.So Samsung's One UI is still my go to skin for Android smartphones and let's notforget, Samsung also bumped up the software update policy too.So Samsung promised a total of four generations of Android OS updatesand five years of security patches for the entire GalaxyS21 and Galaxy S22 series of smartphones.That's actually even better than Google themselves.And we shouldn't forget about the main star of the show, the S Pen.Since the Galaxy S22Ultra is basically a Note, the S Pen is stored inside the phone.However, whatever color of the Galaxy S22 Ultra that you've bought,only the tip of the pen will correspond to the phone's color.The entire shaft of the pen is still going to be black color.That is not a big deal, but the thinness is a big deal to me.Yes, it's much more convenient than the Galaxy S21 Ultra,which needs to use a specific case just to carry the S Pen aroundand we don't have to deal with deteriorating cases too.Yeah, the original Samsung case for the Galaxy S21 Ultrawith the S Pen has just deteriorated for me.But comparing the size of the s pen of the GalaxyS21 Ultra and the Galaxy S22 Ultra, you can clearly seethe difference in thickness and also the size in general.The thicker body is definitely much more comfortable to holdand the Galaxy S22 Ultra's S Pen is just the same twig-like S Penthat we've seen in the Galaxy Note 20 series of smartphones.Still, if you just want to whip out the S Penand take a quick note or to sketch something,then that shouldn't be a problem.Or else you can get the LAMY Safari Twin Penwhich has a ballpoint pen plus an S Pen for a much more comfortable grip.Or you can even get the S Pen Pro our review at the top right corner there.What I'm impressed though, is that the new S Pen really feels responsivethanks to Samsung's new prediction algorithm that enhances the latencyof the S Pen down to just 2.8 milliseconds.The numbers don't put anything into perspective,but I really felt the differencewhen I started writing or drawing on the Galaxy S22 Ultra.As a quick mention, the new Samsung Notes can convert more handwritten languagejust into text as well.I only know how to writeEnglish and Malay, so I can't really test that out for you.Even though I'm Chinese, I don't actually know how to read or write Chinese.And so finally, the question is should you buy the Galaxy S22 Ultra?Well if you're already eyeing a new Galaxy Note smartphone then the Galaxy S22Ultra is your only option to me.The Galaxy S22 Ultra is like improving the Galaxy S21 Ultra,which is really my personal perfect phone for the year 2021.And then Samsung just took this phone, added an S Peninside the phone and voila the Galaxy S22 Ultra.What I'm concerned though is the starting configuration of the Galaxy S22Ultra is a bit insufficient.I suggest you not to get a base version at 128GB of storage at the price of RM5099.128GB of storage is just insufficient,especially with the cameras on the Galaxy S22 Ultrawhich are so good that I think anyone owning this phonewould just go trigger happy and start snapping pictures everywhere.I suggest you to get at least the 256GB version at a price of RM5499.Yes, the price is steeper.But if you are willing to spend that much for a smartphone, then I can assure youthat price is worth your money.But this review isn't the last contentthat we're going to have for the Galaxy S22 Ultra.We'll have a lot more comingsoon, particularly the comparison with the Galaxy S21 Ultra.Again, do subscribe for that.And before you end this video, there's one more questionthat a lot of people have been asking me.Will I change my daily driver phone from the GalaxyZ Fold3 to the brand new Galaxy S22 Ultra?I can't really answer that.Maybe not now, I guess?The Galaxy Z Fold3's massive display when it is unfoldedis just something that other phones cannot replicate.So, yeah, that's that's what's holding me back.So, yeah, that's our in-depth review of the Galaxy S22 Ultra.If you have any questions to leave themin the comments section below, I'll try to answer them whenever I can.And we see you guys in our future videoregarding the Galaxy S22 Ultra.Goodbye."
_O6j6sstyh0,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- Now that the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is available.How does it compareto last year's Samsung galaxy S21 Ultra?What's up guys.Saf here on SuperSaf TV.And that's exactly what we'll be finding out in this video.We're going to be doing a side by side comparison,SuperSaf Style.And we'll be trying to answer the question.If you've got the S21 Ultra right nowshould you upgrade to the S22 Ultra?And if you're new in the market, which one should you buy?I want to initially kick off by talking about the design.Now I'm going to just go ahead and say thisin my personal opinion,I think the S21 Ultra is a better looking devicethanks to this console cut camera modulewhich blends into the edges.This is a really unique design and the S21 Ultrawas my favorite-looking smartphone of 2021.And it still holds up.The S22 Ultra is not bad by any means.We've got these individual camera rings,which do look pretty good.I just prefer the contour cut camera module.They're both roughly about the same when it comesto the size and weight.But the thing to noteis that the S21 Ultra is a lot more curved on the edgesversus the more squared edges on the S22 Ultra.And you guys probably already know this,but this is because the S22 Ultrais following the design languageof Note devices that we've had previously,compared to S devices.I'd also say that the S21 Ultraoverall is a little bit more comfortable to hold.Thanks to these curves on the edgesversus the more pokey sides of the S22 Ultra,but the S22 Ultra is available in more colors.So the S21 Ultra is availablein a phantom black and a phantom silver.It was also available in a few exclusive colorswhich you can no longer from samsung.com.The S22 Ultra comes in four colors.We've got a phantom black, a phantom white,a burgundy as well as a green.And there are three additional exclusive colors availablefrom samsung.com.We've got a red, a graphite as well as a sky blue.If you're interested in picking one of those upyou can use my link in the descriptionand that's also going to give you $50 of credit.And both devices are really premium.And we've got an aluminum armor framewith Gorilla Glass Victus on the S21 Ultra,and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the S22 Ultra.This is apparently 12.5% stronger.I'm not sure how they've reached this numberand I'm not somebody who does drop tests,but the S21 Ultra has been quite durable in my experience.And I expect the S22 Ultra to be the same or even better.Both devices do have IP68 water and dust resistance.And let's now move over to the front.So both are following the Infinity-Odesigned with small bezels and a punch out.Both devices are also curved on the edges.However, the S22 Ultra does have more of a pronounced curvecompared to that on the S21 Ultra.Both devices have a 6.8 inch displaywith Dynamic AMOLED 2X technologyQuad HD Plus resolution with a refresh rateof up to 120 Hertz, making everything really smooth.Now, let me just go ahead and saythat the S21 Ultra had one of the best displays of 2021,and it still holds up today.It's still one of the best displayson the smartphone market,but of course Samsung has improved a few things hereon the S22 Ultra.Firstly, the adaptive refresh rate can go all the way downto just one Hertz.Whereas the S21 Ultra can only onto 10 Hertz.This is going to make the S22 Ultra displaya little bit more efficient.And we also had a higher peak brightnesson the S22 Ultra all the way up to 1,750 nitscompared to the already very bright displayon the S21 Ultra with 1,500 nits.So realistically speaking,both of these are excellent displaysand you can't go wrong with either,but yes the S22 Ultra does have some improvements.Both also have an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner.This is the Qualcomm 3D Sonic Gen 2 sensor.So that's not a change.This works really well.I like it and I really do prefer itto optical in-display fingerprint scannerswhich shine a big light whenever you're trying to unlock.Let's now talk about the cameras,but just to quickly remind you.If you're enjoying this video so farand you want to see more videos like thisthen maybe consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon.So you're notified as soon as I upload a fresh new video.Now I know a lot of you guys are interestedin the camera setup and what the differences are.I'm going to try to break everything down for youas best I can with some samples as well.Now on paper, they seem pretty much exactly the same.We've got a 40 megapixel selfie camerawith a quad rear-facing camera setup and laser auto focus.You've got a 12 megapixel ultra wide cameraand generally speaking, you get some great resultswith both of these excellent dynamic rangewith lots of detail.Then we have the 108 megapixel primary cameras.Now the S22 Ultra does have larger pixelsaround 1.2, three times.So in good light,I think they are still pretty much neck and neck.But when it comes to low light,I've noticed that on the S22 Ultrayou don't have to keep the shutter openfor as long as you have to do on the S21 Ultra.Also, when it comes to extreme low-light situationsI did find that the S22 Ultra performed better.And one of the other new features that we've goton the S22 Ultra is detail enhancer at 108 megapixels.Now, once again the S21 Ultrastill takes great images at 108 megapixels.But, if you look really, really closeyou might notice that's with the detail enhancer on,you are just going to get some more crisp detailson the S22 Ultra.Now, when it comes to the zoom cameras,both have a three timesas well as a 10 times optical zoom camera.And to be fair, the S21 Ultra still holds up.But thanks to the improvementson the image signal processor and software,the S22 Ultra was a tad sharper, I found.And when we zoom in at 10 times, again they're very close,but when we get to 30 timesyou will start noticing that on the housethe lines are just a little bit more definedon the S22 Ultra compared to the S21 Ultra.And when we go in all the way to 100 times zoomwhich is super creepy,again, the S21 ultra is still holding up.But the S22 Ultra just has some nice refinements.Again, those lines are just clearer on the S22 Ultra.Now one area where I definitely did notice an improvementon the S22 Ultra is when it comes to portrait.So Samsung is using a new AI depth mapping algorithmand this is really good at detecting edges.So although the S21 Ultra still does pretty wellyou'll notice in these examples that the S22 Ultrais just better when it comes to edge detection.Now on the S21 Ultra you can take portraitsat one times, two times, as well as three times.On the S22 Ultra,you can only take portraits at one times and three times.Now, I'm really not concerned about thisbecause when you are at two times on the S21 Ultra,it's actually using digital zoom because the S21 Ultradoes not have a two times dedicated optical zoom camera.And this results in very soft images at two times anyway.For video, both can record at 8K 24 frames a secondand 4k 60 frames a second across all cameras.But we do have some new features on the S22 Ultra.Firstly, thanks to that depth mapping technologythe portrait video is better,and you can also do portrait video with bothone times as well as the three times optical zoom cameraon the S22 Ultra.On the S21 Ultra, you can only do it at one times.The S22 Ultra also has a new feature called Auto Framing.This is where it's going to take a wide angle viewand then zoom into subjects.I mean, this does work.It's not something I can see myself using too much.So generally speakingalthough there are some improvements here on the S22 Ultra,I still feel that the S21 Ultra has excellent cameraswhich still do hold up.Let's now talk about the performance.So the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultracomes with last year's chip sets.We've got the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888or the Samsung Exynos 2100, depending on your region.The S22 Ultracomes with the latest Qualcomm snapdragon 8 Gen 1or the Samsung Exynos 2200.Now, it's really difficult to talk about performancebecause having tried both of these outthey do handle everything that I've thrown at them.Now I'm not somebody who games too much on my smartphonebut my buddy Thunder E from Booredatwork is a gamer.And in his testing, he did find that the S22 Ultradid maintain slightly lower temperatureswhen gaming for a longer period of time.And it was also more efficient over time.So after say an hour of gaminghe did lose less battery lifeon the S22 Ultra compared to the S21 Ultra.I'm going to leave his video linkeddown in the description belowif you want to check that out.But generally speaking, yes the S22 Ultrais going to give you a slight edge in terms of performance.But the S21 Ultra is still really, really good.Now for Ram, the S21 Ultra does have more Ramcompared to the S22 Ultra.You've got either 12 or 16 gigabytes.The S22 Ultra has eight or 12 gigabytes.Now, in my day to dayI really did not find much of a difference.There's also a feature called Ram Pluswhich is going to give you some more virtual memorythat it's going to take from the Ram.Honestly speaking, everything that I triedworked absolutely fine on both of these devices.And I didn't really notice too much of a difference.Sure, if you're going to be switching through many, many appsthen the 16 gigabyte Ram versionof the S21 Ultra might give you a slight edge.I personally don't have that with me.So I can't test that out, Unfortunately.Now for software,both devices currently have Android 12 with one UI.We've got one UI 4.0 just updated on my S21 Ultra.On the S22 Ultra, it comes with one UI, 4.1 out of the box.Samsung has been really good with updatesand they are also supporting their devicesfor quite a bit longer compared to many other competitors.But being the new device the S22 Ultrais obviously going to have updates for a longer period of timecompared to the S21 Ultra.Now, before we talk about the batterieslet's talk about the feature that makes the S22 Ultraunique and different to the S21 Ultra.And that is the enclosed S Pen.So the S21 Ultra does have support for the S Pen.However, this is something that's not enclosedwithin the deviceand it's something that you have to buy separately.Now, I did try the S Pen on the S21 Ultra last yearbut because there wasn't really somewhere to house it,you'd have to get a bulky case or something.And I really found myself not using it at all.However, with the S22 Ultra,it is carrying over that Note DNAand having the S Pen enclosed within the devicereally makes a big difference.So if you are somebody like me who uses is the S Pen a lotfor editing images and other things,then I really do think you'll appreciate having the S Penincluded with the S22 Ultra.Right, battery size and battery life.So both devices have the exact same battery size,5,000 mAh.Now it is quite impressivethat Samsung has managed to get this size batteryinto the S22 Ultra, considering that the S Pendoes take up space inside the device.And what has my experience been with battery life?So the S21 Ultra for me has had really good battery life.And in my usage of the S22 Ultraso far I'm getting pretty similar battery lifecompared to the S21 Ultra.So that's roughly about six hours plus of screen on timewith my usage.I know usage varies from person to personbut I haven't really noticed a huge deal of difference.It's not like the S22 Ultra is lasting me a lot longeror a lot less.Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing,because once again I want to emphasizethat the S21 Ultra does have excellent battery life.Now for charging, both of these have the same speedof Qi Wireless Charging at 15 Watts.So this hasn't been improved.We've also got reverse wireless chargingwireless power share,where you can charge things like earbudson the back of these devices.And neither of these comewith a charger included out of the box.However, the S22 Ultra can support faster 45 watt charging.Whereas the S21 Ultracan only support a maximum of 25 watts of charging.Now for speakerswe've got really good stereo speakers on both devices.We've got one in the ear piece and one button firing.They both sound pretty much the same to me.However, I do prefer the positioning of the speakeron the S21 Ultra, which is in the same space as the camera.So when I am gaming, occasionally,then I'm not really going to block it up.Now, I know most people when they gameuse earphones, I don't.With the S22 Ultra,if you are holding the device in landscapethen you can cover the bottom (indistinct) speaker.Right, finally storage and pricing.So both devices are available in a 128, 256,as well as a 512 gigabyte version.However, the S22 Ultra is also availablein a one terabyte version, if you really need that storage.Neither are expandable.And the S22 Ultra does startat the same price as the S21 Ultra started at.However, you do get eight gigabytes of Raminstead of the 12 gigabytes of RAM for the base model.And there are slight differencesfor the larger storage versions.However, because the S21 Ultra has been out for a year.If you want to pick it up right now,you can get it for around 800 pounds or $900 renewed.The S22 Ultra, Samsung are actually giving some really crazypre-order deals.So right now on Samsung's websiteyou can get the 256 gigabyte version for the priceof the 128 gigabyte version, or the 512 gigabyte versionfor the price of the 256 gigabyte version.You can also get an additional $50 of creditusing my link down in the description below.As well as some really good trade-in offers.So to answer the question from the start of this video.If you have an S21 Ultra,should you upgrade it to the S22 ultra?In my personal opinion, don't think so.I think the S21 Ultra is still an excellent deviceand it's still going to be absolutely fine for you.Yes, you're getting quite a few improvements hereon the S22 Ultrabut I don't think they're significant enoughto warrant an upgrade already.However, if you are somebody who uses the S Pen a lotand maybe you want to take advantageof some of those trade-in deals.Then it might be worth considering trading in your S21 Ultraand getting the S22 Ultra.And if you're somebody who's currently thinkingshould you buy the S21 Ultra insteadof the S22 Ultra and save a bit of money?In my personal opinion,with all of the pre-order deals that you can get right now.I would go for the S22 Ultra.You're getting the newer deviceand it's going to last you that much longer.That's what I think anyway.What do you guys think?Do drop me a comment below and let me know your thoughts.If you want to see more S22 Ultra contentmaybe you want to see how it compares to the Note20 Ultrathen that video's going to be linked hereas well as another related video here.If you want to see more content like this going forward,then once again, don't forget to subscribeand hit that bell icon.I hope you enjoyed this video on (indistinct)If you did then do smash that light button for me.Thanks for watching.This is Saf on SuperSaf TV, and I'll see you next time."
LOMS8osPcyw,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"Uhh!!So yes guys let's startSo in this video we have the Samsung S22Here it's one kidney😂And here's the other one iphone 13(Breaking news)As you have asked for its comparisonSo here we have bought the comparison of two kidneys🤣And both of the phones have many things in commonLike the box of both of them are on dietingIt means we don't get any charger in both the boxesHear both of the phones are 5G and you get a lot of 5G bands with both of themHere S22 has total 16 5G bandsWhereas iphone have every 5G band  on which 5G is going to comeBut here I will take 5G bands as equal in both of themBecause 5G have not rolled out yet and both of them are giving many 5G bandsRest both of them comes with 4G carrier aggregationAnd cellular connectivity of both of them is top-notchAnd both of them have one more thing in commonScreen size of both of them is 6.1 inchAnd both of them are very comfortable and compact phonesAnd there isn't any type of cost cutting in both of themHere we get glass on the backside in bothIphone have the custom corning glassWhereas Samsung have corning gorilla glass victusSo we get the flagship protectionBut here the iphone was having glossy finish , so I have applied matt skinNow its not a promotion of the skin😅😂(Ah..we got sscammed🥲)Now I have done this becauseBecause gloss finish was having many fingerprints and smudgesAnd I got frustrated while cleaning themWhereas Samsung have already gave mat finishAnd it get very less smudges on itSecondly ,both of them have the side frame of aluminiumBut here the Samsung have given a little gloss finishBut after that also it don't get any fingerprintsWhereas iphone have given a proper mat finishAdd the side frame of iphone is proper flatIt can easily stand on its legs🤣Whereas samsung have tried to give flat frameBut it is roundedSo here it cannot stand on its legs🤣So Samsung is not able to stand on its own legs😏(auu!! you can't do it)Here talking about the weightIphone's weight is slightly higherBut both of them feels very comfortableSo all over the only difference here is in designWhich I leave on youAlthough companies haven't brought any new designHere iphone have almost same  old iphone 12 designAnd Samsung also gave the same old design of S21They've just made the side frame little flatNow the biggest difference in these phones is on the frontNow although both of them have 6.1 inch displayBut when you see them from the frontThen you're going to pick the SamsungBecause we get a clear experience in itWhether we talk about the side bezzels or the chinThey are very less compared to iphoneAnd additionally Samsung have given the punch-holeBut iphone is still stuck on the notchAlthough it's less compared to the last timeBut still , when you watch content in both the displays side by sideThen we get a full view experience in Samsung's displayAlthough the protection on both the displays is of flagship levelSamsung have given corning Gorilla Glass Victus's protectionAnd we get ceramic shield in iphoneBoth of them are flagship level protectionNow directly talking about the displaySo iphone offers super retina XDR OLED panelWhereas Samsung have dynamic amoled 2X panelBoth of them are FHD+ displaysBut here the pixel per inch density of iphone is little higherBecause here we get little better resolution compared to SamsungBut here the Samsung have the advantage howThat it's a 120Hz panelWhich iphone is giving in its Pro and Max SeriesSo when you use both of them side by sideThen in the terms of smoothness Samsung looks performing betterThe second thing is thatIphones's display comes with HDR10 and dolby vision supportAnd Samsung's display comes with HDR10+ certificationSo these are the on paper thingsBut when we watched the content on both side by sideThen here whether we talk about sharpness or the brightnessSo it was looking good in HDR content in IphoneAnd you can see it clearlyAnd this can be becauseIphone's display have more PPI compared to the SamsungAlthough both of them are flagship level displayBut as we are comparing themThen the content viewing experience of iphone's display is slightly betterRest you get a massive brightness in both of themIphone offers you 1200 nits peak brightnessWhereas Samsung gives 1300 nits peak brightnessAt Indoor both of them performs almost equallyBut outdoor You can see that iphone feels more brighter than the SamsungAnd here's one more thingLike when you use Samsung for some timeThen it becomes little warm and drops its brightness very quickly at outdoorBut Samsung have many advantagesLike firstly it have always on displayWhich iphone is not able to provide yet despite of giving OLED panelsSo you aren't getting these things after giving you kidney also🥲😅(Please stop it😭)Secondly we get a ultrasonic fingerprint sensorWhose speed is very fastAnd in Apple we dont get any touch IDAlthough we used to get it at the time of iphone 7 or 8But now we only get the face IDAnd you may know that since COVID many Apple users are getting frustratedSo here touch ID looks little betterSo the main topic between them is the cameraSo whose cameras are greatIn iphone we get a 12MP camera in front in this big notchWhereas Samsung have given a 10MP camera in this punch-holeSo first of all, you can enjoy the videoSo we can record in 4K 60FPS from front with both the kidneys🤣And here samsung's stabilisation is looking slightly betterRest you can see the light controlAnd here all over skin tone will depend on your personal preferenceSo you guys tell me whose video quality was goodAnd tell me about the audio quality alsoSo now you are seeing me in opposite lightHere dynamic range of iphone is looking better to meRest Samsung have dropped its brightness a lot😅So Samsung have launched this Flagship phoneAnd I have seen one thing that when you record a videoThen it takes delay for 1 secondWhich not looks good according to a flagshipBut Samsung's stabilisation looks better Compared to iphoneWhereas the skin tone and light on face looks controlled better on iphoneAnd there's one more thingWhen sun comes at the back then Samsung is not able to control the light in the skyWhereas iphone does it very nicelySo still iphone's video quality looks better in comparison with SamsungRest we have captured a lot of photos alsoHere you can see themA dynamic range of both is almost equalBut the difference comes in the skin toneIphone gives a little warm toneAnd Samsung gives a little cool toneWhich depends on your personal preferenceRest details look almost equal in bothSee ,I've already told that don't look at the MP Look at the photosRest Light control also looks sameAnd in portrait mode their edge detection also looks performing sameBut the skin tone in iphone looks a bit naturalWhile Samsung make it little smoothWhich will also depend on your personal preferenceSo that's all about the front cameraNow let's move to the back camerasHere in iphone we get a 12 MP main camera sensor with sensor shiftWhereas in Samsung we get a 50MP camera sensor with OISHere I have recorded video alsoHere the stabilisation of both of them is good in normal walkBut in Samsung you can see the light on the faceIt was not able to control it as good as iphone have doneAnd in iphone depth also looks good in comaprison with SamsungSo, still the iphone is better in the video qualityRest I have took videos while running alsoAnd I've seen stabilisation performing almost equal in both of themNow we get video bookeh mode in both of themSamsung says it portrait video modeAnd iphone says its cinematic video modeAnd here I've seen one thingLike Samsung have improved it a lotalthough the colours of iphone still looks betterBut the edge detection of portrait video mode of Samsung looks more betterBut Samsung also have the over sharpeningRest we have captured photos alsoAdd Depth-of-field looks more better in iphoneWhereas the colours of Samsung were little betterAnd when you capture the photo of any humanThen you can see that I have done a poll on Twitter between A and BAll the photos of ""B"" were of the iphoneAnd 90% of the people have picked the iphoneHere you can see the light in the backgroundIphone have controlled it betterEven skin tone also looks betterAnd dynamic range also looks goodI haven't seen any consistency in SamsungSometimes it make shirt very bright And sometimes it make it very dullAnd the light control on the face in direct sunlightwas also better in iphoneThat you can see the photos in every scenarioEven in opposite light also iphone's dynamic range is greatAnd we have captured photo in portrait mode alsoHere if we talk about the edge detection and the light controlNow also iphone performs betterAnd here the difference comes only in the skin toneWhich I leave on youRest here Samsung have one advantageWhich is telephoto camera sensorBecause it have 10MP 3X telephoto camera sensorBy which you can capture till 30X digitallyBut its main use is thatYou can capture photos with it in portrait mode alsoAnd it captures very great photosWhich is not present in iphoneThe only Samsung have provided this featureBTW we have captured photos with and without night mode alsoWithout nightmode Samsung performs betterAnd with night mode iphone is brightHere the difference comes in the toneHere iphone gives the warm tone whereas Samsung gives the coolWhich I will again leave on youAnd here all over as much I have seenIn night mode iphone will provide more bright photosRest both of them have the ultrawide camera sensoriphone have 12MP sensor with 120° Field-of-viewAnd Samsung have also provided 12MP cameraAnd here I have noticed one thingLike samsung captures with 0.6xAnd iphone captures with 0.5xEven on-paper its 120° Field-of-viewBut here field-of-view looks more good in iphoneSo dynamic range and details are almost equal in bothEven colours also looks sameBut when you capture opposite sunlight photosThen iphone performs little betterSo I am as much I've seen both the phones in camera partNow also iphone performs consistent compared to SamsungNow here comes the main thing-the performanceIn Samsung we get 8 Gen 1 processorIts built on 4nm and its a octa-core processorWhereas in Apple we get A15 bionic processorIts built on 5NM and is an Hexacore processorSo here I have tested both of themBut before that , both of the phones are very good for a normal userHere in day to day life, app opening- closing and scrolling looks very niceBut there also Samsung gets a advantage of 120 hertzBut for a normal person both the phones are topBut here to test the performance for heavy user I ran antutuSo here I turned the brightness full and removed apps from backgroundAnd I started at the same time in both of themAnd when we noted the temperatureThen iphone's temperature at the begining was 32° CelsiusWhereas Samsung was 34° celsiusSo the score we saw at the endIn Apple it was 7,32,290And its temperature at the end was 41° CelsiusIn Samsung the score was 7,72,766And its temperature at the end was 43° in the first antutuAnd the amazing thing was that both haven't dropped their brightnessSo we ran the test once againAnd this time also iphone completed its processing fastAt this time the score was 6,69,529And its temperature went to 42.8° Whereas the score of Samsung was 6,37956It have majorly dropped its scoreAnd its score is not of the 8 Gen 1Because the score of 8 Gen 1 is around 10,00,000 And its last score was 8,00,000And here we are not able to see that alsoAnd in second antutu it have dropped the score alotYou also can see thatAnd this time its body temperature was 44.8° CelsiusSo here Samsung have underclocked its performance a littleSo maybe Samsung can fix it with an updateBut we dont have any clue that when it will get fixedSo as much we have tested with antutuThe consistency is great in the appleSo people are saying that antutu doesn't matter to themThen I would like to say thatLike if I have used a phone for 1-2 monthsAnd you ask me about it Like I am currently using iphoneThen I can easily tell you that how is its performanceBecause I have used this phone completelyWhereas if I got the phone and I have to post its video in 1-2 daysThen I have to test its peak performance by running these testsSo if anyone watch my videoThen he/she can know that how is it speak performanceAnd as we do the game tests to Know that how the phone can perform in gamingSo by this the user get the experience that what the phone is capable ofAnd if we don't do these things in our initial impressionsAnd if anyone buys the phone by watching our videoThe you will blame us that you have told this and we get thisSO antutu and some other tests are really important in initial impressionsAnd I also believe in these thingsNow see that how this on paper score relates practicallyHere we used the same fileWe kept the same export settings alsoAnd here the rendering speed of iphone is far better than the SamsungIt renders in almost half timeAnd secondly if you want to do gamingAnd you are confused that which would be better for gamingSo here both of them have great settingsAlthough both of them dont have 90 FPS option yetBut when you do gaming in both of themThen you can easily do good gaming for 1-1.5 hourBut if you are a hardcore gamerThen I will suggest you the iphoneHere you can see the same thing with this testHere you can see that frames are more consistent in iphoneSo here all-over If you want to do Hardcore gamingThen you can go with the iphoneWhereas if you want to play for Sometime only then I can recommend SamsungSo all over as much we have seenIn the performance department Both the Phones are really goodBut the flagship performance is still great in the iphoneRest both of them have stereo speakers And both are very loudHere loudness is equalBut iphone's speakers are little bit more cleanAnd they are a bit BassyAlso the haptics of iphone are more solidBut in Samsung you get haptics at more places in UIRest talking about the batterySo as both the phones are small so they have the small batteriesIn Samsung you get 3700 mAh battery with 25 watt fast chargingAnd in Apple we get 3240 mAh battery with 23 watt fast chargingAnd both the phone supports 15 watts wireless chargingAn iphone we also get 7.5 watts magsafe chargingMeans you can charge it by sticking it to the backWhereas in Samsung we get reverse wireless charging of 4.5 WattsWhich is very usefulSo here charging time of both is almost sameBut if we talk about battery backupThen I can clearly say thatThe battery backup of iphone 13 isfar far far better compared to samsungYou have to charge this phone at least two times in a dayWhereas you can easily use the iphone for a daySo all over opinion timeIf you are looking for a comfortable  and compact phone in AndroidWith clean UI and long term update support and with good cameras alsoThen definitely Samsung have launched S22But we have to keep two things in mindThat it's battery backup is very weakAnd secondly This phone starts heating in little little tasksMeans it have warm issues in normal tasks alsoBut if you are confused in these both phonesThen definitely if we talk about cameras, performance, or battery backupSo iphone takes a lead in these termsBut I got two cons in iphoneLike first is notch and secondly the 60 Hz panel which feels outdatedSo after taking a kidney apple is lacking in these things 🤣So tell me which phone you likedSo that's it guys Let's meet in another cool and exciting videoTill then stay tuned with HFV Unbox Guys!!!BYEEE !!!"

nice work samsung todaywe're going to find out how durable thismatte black s22 ultra is and how well itcan stand up to everyday life inside thebox we get the phoneand a usbc charging cableand that's about it right off the bat ido have to say i'm a fan of theseindividualized camera bumpsbut we'll get to that more in a secondlet's get started[Applause][Music]samsung has combined their note line ands line of phones into one and i'mdefinitely okay with that the phoneswere basically the same anyway minus thes pen so it just makes sense let's startwith the scratch testsamsung says they are running gorillaglass victus on the front and back ofthe phone there doesn't appear to be anyplastic screen protectors installedthose would scratch at a level two orthreewhile tempered glass scratches at a fiveor six and sapphire would scratch at alevel eight or nine we do get somerockage with all the cameras being onone side but that's not too big of adealwe see the screen start scratching at alevel six with deeper grooves at a levelseven so far so goodalso on camera you'll notice this superweird flashing of the display i thinkthat's the super low refresh ratesamsung is talking about but it does notshow up in real life to the naked eyespeaking of eyes cyclops up here in thecenter is a 40 megapixel selfie cameraalong with very minimal bezels and anearpiece lift about the thickness of

the insideslicing it open so we can get a goodlook it's sealed pretty good with theblack plastic all around the exterioronce we get in we see the copper coilsaround the shaft that let the

rubber itusually does a pretty good job ofwaterproofingthe back half of the shaft is alsoencased in plasticand once again we see a capacitor insideinstead of a battery the capacitor iswhat allows the s-pen to hold powerwhile it's away from the phone so it cando its clicky take-y pictures thingthere's also a ton of glue in here tokeep moisture off the circuits prettycool thumbs up if you like

axDD8gpbJVs,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,what's happening everyone my name is Alex and  welcome back in today's video we are checking  out one of the latest phones from xiaomi the  xiaomi 12T and comparing it to one of the most  popular phones available on the market the Samsung  Galaxy s22 now because the Samsung Galaxy s22 has  been out for quite some time well these days  you can find a used one already furbished one  for roughly the same price as you would pay  for a new xiaomi 12T so I figured this would  be a good comparison to make all right let's  start by checking out the boxes and what comes  in the box with them both devices all right  big box small box one manufacturer here is  pretending to save the planet by not including  much in the box that's the Samsung here so in  the box of the s22 you basically get a cable  and that's about it but to the 12T you do get  them a bunch of things so first of all we have  a clear case for the device then we have the  cable and then we have a fast charger this  is an 120 watt fast Chargers so the 12T here  supports 120 watt fast charging where the Samsung  Galaxy s22 supports 25 watt fast charging so you'd  have to buy your own slow charger for the s22 now  as for charging speeds if you have a 25 watt fast  charger for the s22 it would take about 50 minutes  to fully charge this phone from 0 to 100 to the 12  T it only takes about 20 minutes to charge it  from 0 to 100 so inside the 12T we have a 5 000  milliamp hour battery we're inside the s22 we have  a 3700 milliamp hour battery so the battery life  on the 12T is also better than the battery life  that you're gonna get on the Samsung Galaxy s22  moving on to design and build quality well here  I can't really say that one is better than the  other one so they both have glass on the front and  on the back they both look pretty good they both  have metallic frames they actually have the power  buttons and the volume buttons on the exact same  side nothing on the other side of of the devices  and at the top there would the xiaomi 12T we do  get an IR blaster something that we don't have the  Samsung Galaxy s22 they both have dual speakers so  one at the top there and one at the bottom there  even the SIM card trades kind of positioned in the  same place for both devices so design wise I guess  it really comes down if you want a smaller form  factor or the larger form factor from the xiaomi  12T moving on to the front of the two devices  well here we have a 6.67 inches AMOLED screen  on the xiaomi 12T where on the Samsung Galaxy  s22 we have a 6.1 inches AMOLED screen they both  have the same resolution and they both have the  same refresh rate of 120 hertz now both screens do  look really good I can't really say anything bad  about either screen but the screen on the s22  here does get them a bit brighter so the peak  brightness on on the Samsung Galaxy s22 is 1300  nits where the peak brightness for the xiaomi  12 team is 900 nits so you will see the Samsung  Galaxy s22 better in direct sunlight than you're  gonna see the 12 team but keep in mind that the  price of the new s22 is more expensive than the  price that you'd pay for a new xiaomi 12T both  the 12T and the s22 have in-screen fingerprint  scanners now personally I'm not a fan of in-screen  fingerprint scanners on most phones and that's  kind of the case for these two devices as for  the fingerprint scanner speeds I filled that  the 12T is a bit faster to unlock than the Samsung  Galaxy s22 but if I would have the choice I would  actually prefer a physical fingerprint scanner  but yes they do have um in-screen fingerprint  scanners on both these devices as I mentioned  earlier both devices have dual speakers so one  other top we actually have the holes for the  speaker right at the top on the 12T where on the  s22 is just there above on the screen and another  speaker at the bottom now it seems to me that  the 12T has the better speakers but let me play a  quick recording here so you can hear from yourselfforeignokay so after listening to both of them side by  side I actually feel that the s22 sounds better  but what do you guys think do you prefer the  s22 or the 12 T4 those speakers I also forgot  to mention the screen on the s22 is covered by  Gorilla Glass victus where the screen on the  12T is covered by Gorilla Glass 5. so technically  if you'd be to drop the s22 the screen shouldn't  crack as um easily but realistically if you drop  both devices the wrong way they will perform crack  all right moving on to Performance so the Samsung  Galaxy s22 we have the exynos 228 gigs of RAM  where would the xiaomi 12T we have the mediatek  diamond City 8108 gigs of RAM so keep in mind  that the s22 is basically Samsung's flagship  for um 2022 where the 12T is not xiaomi's flag  ship Forum this year if we open the gallery  here I have a couple of screenshots of The  antutu Benchmark score so here the Samsung  Galaxy s22 gets a higher Benchmark score I  was kind of expecting that even though you can't  really tell the difference in performance what I  found interesting is the fact that the xiaomi  12T gets faster reading and writing speeds for  the internal storage compared to the s22 I wasn't  actually expecting that now even though we have a  bit of a difference for that Benchmark score  you can't really tell the difference whenever  you are actually using the devices so whatever  you are doing on them it does feel the same on  both devices but I did notice that the Samsung  Galaxy s22 gets much hotter than the 12 team so  you'll have more throttling and UDA s22 and every  airplane games for an extended periods of time I'm  just going to open a couple of apps just so you  can see how they both open these apps so really  no difference in performance at least difference  that I've noticed in between these two devices  so everything is kind of the same on both of  them and the same goes for pretty much all  um applications so we have MIUI 13 on the 12T  and I believe one UI 4.1 on the s22 moving on  to something that's different between these  two devices and those are the cameras so on the  back there the 12T has a main camera that's 108  megapixel where the s22 has a main camera that's a  15 megapixel now I've said this many times I feel  the s22 gets the best cameras from any smartphone  this year so in 2022 I have some pictures that  I took side by side just so you can show you  a couple of examples and do like a full camera  comparison between these two phones but just so  you get an idea of the pictures they're gonna take  on the s22 and the pictures they're gonna take on  UDA 12 team then we have the ultra white cameras  I feel that the Samsung Galaxy s22 does better  with its ultra white camera once again and then  on the back of the 12th T we have a macro camera  that's a 2 megapixel um sensor so nobody's  really gonna use that 2 megapixel sensor  on the back of the s-22 we have a three times  telephoto lens so I feel that that's more useful  um for most situations of course so personally I  filled that the s22 does better with the cameras  when compared to the xiaomi 12T so yeah these are  some of the main differences between the xiaomi  12T and the Samsung Galaxy in s22 which one do  you think is the better buy on here the 12T or  the Samsung Galaxy s22 now of course if you'd be  to buy both devices new the xiaomi 12T is about  200 dollars some cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy  s22 but if you'd be to find a used Samsung Galaxy  s22 then the price is fairly similar with the  new xiaomi 12T definitely leave a comment and  let me know your thoughts alright thanks for  watching and I'll see you guys in the next one
EhEMhqfX72o,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"If you remember, I had referred to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra as the first true Android superphone.For me, a superphone is something that further redefines flagship Android phones with a combinationof extremely powerful specifications, smarter software, and the overall experience thatcould put most computing devices in the shade.And now we have the second superphone, as I would still like to call it.The Galaxy S22 Ultra.This is the latest Galaxy flagship, and really, there is no other way of putting this—thegreatest Samsung phone ever.And I say this after rigorously testing this device to truly understand that this isn’tjust a typical annual refresh, but a lot of thought has gone into making the S22 Ultrathe package that it actually is.First up, if you want this Android setup, let me know by giving this video 5000 likesand I'll make a tutorial on how to set this up on your phone.With that said, the S22 Ultra is the device that any Galaxy Note fan has been waitingfor as it combines the very best of the Note and the S lineup into a device that has itall.I've been a huge fan of Note's boxy design over the years and thankfully Samsung hasbrought back that design along with the smooth finish with a less-noticeable camera bump.The result is one of the most complete smartphone designs you’ll find right now; the layoutis gorgeous and almost a month later, I’m still absolutely in love with this phone.The 6.8-inch display is gently curved, so it adds some aesthetic appeal without leadingto accidental screen presses.Samsung is known to make the best displays and the S22 Ultra is no exception.Watching content, scrolling websites, social media sites is such a pleasant experienceon this phone.The colors are vibrant, that deep blacks you get with AMOLED displays, everything is sosatisfying.Also under direct sunlight, the screen seems to be able to more legible than any otherdisplay I’ve ever tested thanks to that 1750 nits of peak brightness.The 120Hz display can also go all the way down to just 1Hz when the content isn't movingand that will help preserve the battery life.Now since this is basically a Note device you get the S Pen as well which is storedat the bottom of the device.All the familiar S-Pen features we’re used to are present such as taking quick noteswith Screen Off Memo, a whole suite of actions one click of the S Pen button away with AirCommand, and there are several ways to control apps like the Gallery and Music Player usingBluetooth and gestures.It's a real joy to write or draw on this device and that's due to the super low latency.It literally feels like writing on paper but 100 times smoother.Of course, the S Pen is not for everyone, a lot of you may use it the first day andforget that it's even there the next day but If you're the type of person, who take frequentquick notes, who loves to draw or even scroll with the pen then you are going to reallyappreciate that it's there when you need it.The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate, the speakers are loud, bassy,and sound really good.The haptics or vibration motor is better than last year.The vibrations are subtle, precise, and tactile, I far prefer it to the S21 Ultra which feelsflabby and rattly in comparison but since it vibrates in X-axis, I've missed a few callswhen I was out in a crowded place when the phone was in my pocket.I have the Watch 4 as well so it's not an issue but it's something you need to keepin mind.The OneUI software on this thing is the best Samsung has ever shipped.It's clean, fluid, minimalistic, it looks nice and the features are thoughtful.The multitasking experience is something you won't find in any of the competiting devices.Basically, the software experience is very pleasant to use.Plus you'll also get DeX to take your multitasking game to a whole new level.Just hit the dex button and connect your monitor wired or wirelessly and you have a desktop-styleuser interface.As for the performance, it has a flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC with 12GB RAM, andas you'd expect it offers an incredibly fast and slick experience.It is very unlikely that you’ll ever be able to take this to the limit, get closeto the performance ceiling, or even make it slow down.Generally, the phone stays cool almost all the time, although it does get a little hotunder extreme loads such as when playing heavy games for long periods of time or recordinglong 4K videos.The phone comes preinstalled with game optimization service, though which limits the performancein games to keep the temperature down.Samsung has issued an update to turn this feature off but I don't think you should doit because the phone can handle these games absolutely fine.You're not going to even notice that the GOS service is running.And not just games, the phone is incredibly fast in day to day to use.The apps open instantly, they keep remained open in the background with all that RAM readyto go.No matter what you throw at it, it can handle it and it's going to stay fast and fluid foryears.Speaking of years, Samsung will support this device for 5 years with 4 generations of operatingsystem upgrades more than any other Android phone maker.This effectively means the S22 Ultra will be getting Android versions 13, 14, 15, and16 in the future.Impressive stuff and this will definitely add value to the Samsung flagship!Now the phone also comes with a beefy 5000mAh of battery.The battery life is pretty good, it can easily last a whole day with heavy use.There's not a single day that I completely drained the battery.My usage includes social media sites, YouTube, OTT apps, taking photos and videos, and occasionalgaming.Even with heavy use, I still end up with about 30 to 40% charge.Speaking of charging, it can support 45W of fast charging, there is wireless chargingtoo which is very convenient and I personally use it all the time.There's reverse wireless charging as well which you can use to charge other devicesincluding your wearables.It's a pretty nifty feature.The new camera design at the back looks really good, but it gets messy real quick.It collects dust and fingerprints easily so if you're taking photos make sure to cleanthat up otherwise it will ruin your photos.As for the quality, it's incredible.It essentially features much the same hardware as the S21 Ultra, but the differences arenoticeable and this comes down to how Samsung has approached the post-processing.On many occasions, I noticed that the image first taken by the camera was significantlyinferior to the one after it finished processing.The edge detection in portrait photos is the best I've ever seen, the night photos areexcellent, and there's a dramatic improvement in zoom quality.Also, it's safe to say Samsung is right at the top in video recording along with Apple.This video is shot in 4K with the S22 Ultra and I'm really impressed how it takes bettervideos than most of the DSLRs with nice bokeh and vibrant colors while also retaining thedetails.Basically, if you're a noob in photography and you get the S22 Ultra, you will no longerremain a noob.You just have to aim and take photos, and the phone will do the rest.It's that good.So to sum it up, Samsung has taken the best out of the Note lineup and merged it withthe S series to finally arrive at the ultimate all-in-one superphone.It ticks all the boxes of features we truly want or need in a smartphone.And there's no other way to put this, the S22 Ultra is undoubtedly the best phone thatSamsung or any other phone maker has ever made.Let me know your thought on this down in the comments and as always I'll see you tomorrow...peaceout"
3pbs7G2dBn0,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- Now that the best from Samsung,the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, has officially launched,how does it compare to the best from Applein the iPhone 13 Pro Max?What's up, guys?Saf here on SuperSaf TV,and as we do every year,we're going to break down allof the key differences side by side SuperSaf Style.So the first thing I want to talkabout is the build and design.Now design is subjective, but I genuinely dolike the design of both devices, especially the factthat they have this really nice matte finish on the back.And they're also very premium.We've got an aluminum frame for the S22 Ultra.We've got a stainless steel framefor the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which is more durable.Both devices are IP68 water and dust resistant,which is great.However, you can submerge the iPhone 13 Pro Maxin water deeper compared to the S22 Ultra.Now I'm not sure how much of a differencethat's going to make to people,but if you are somebody who likesto take your smartphone for a swim,then you're probably going to be a little bit better offwith the iPhone 13 Pro Max.Now for colors,the iPhone 13 Pro Max is available in four colors.We've got gold, a graphite, a silveras well as the Sierra blue.The S22 Ultra however is available in four base colors.So we have this phantom black, a phantom whitea burgundy, as well as a green,but it's also availablein three additional colors exclusively from samsung.com.We've got a graphite, a sky blue,which looks quite similar to the Sierra blue,as well as a red.So you do get more color options on the S22 Ultra.If you are interested in picking up oneof those exclusive colors,I'll leave a link down in the description belowwhich will also give you $50 of credit.Right, now in terms of the size,I got to say both of these are big devices.The S22 Ultra is slightly taller.Whereas the iPhone 13 Pro Max is slightly wider and heavierand we do have some slight differences.On the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the edges are curvedbut the sides are flat.Whereas on the S22 Ultra,the edges are a lot more squared offbut the sides are more curved.Now personally, I'm used to quite large phonesso I can get on fine with either of these.But if you are coming from a smaller phone,these may take some time to get used to.Right, now let's talk about the displays.These two have excellent large displays:6.7 inches on the iPhone 13 Pro Max,6.8 inches on the S22 Ultra.Now both are also using AMOLED technology.So we've got really nice contrast ratios,deep blacks and vibrant colors,but there are lots of differences.We've got ceramic shield on the iPhone 13 Pro Max.We've got Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the S22 Ultra.Now I'm not somebody who does drop tests,but in my experience, both of these are very durable.The iPhone 13 Pro Max has a flat displaywhereas the S22 Ultra has a curved display on the sides.Now, in my opinion, a curved display does look nicer,but in terms of practicality, I do prefer a flatter display.It's also easier to get screen protectorsfor a flat display compared to that of a curved display.And then if we look at the bezels,we do have small bezels on both devices,but we do get a higher screen to body ratioon the S22 Ultrabecause we have a punch out for the front-facing camera.Whereas we have a notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max.Now this notch is 20% smaller comparedto what we had on the iPhone 12 Pro Max,but notch versus a punch out,the punch out is just way less obtrusive.The S22 Ultra also has many more advantages.So firstly it does have a higher pixel densitybecause of a high resolution.So things will be a tad sharper.And although both devices have a 120 hertz refresh ratewhich makes things very smooth,the S22 Ultra can go all the way down to just one hertz.The iPhone 13 Pro Max goes down to 10 hertz.This will make the S22 Ultra display more efficientand it also allows it to have an always-on display.An always-on display is something that I find super useful.You can see your timeand what notifications you have at a glancewhile your device is sitting there on the table.You don't even have to pick it up.This is something that's unfortunately not availableon the iPhone 13 Pro Max.I was really hoping for it this time.The S22 Ultra also has a brighter displaywith a peak brightness of 1,750nits.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is also a bright displaybut it peaks out at around 1200nits.So if you're somebody like mewho uses your smartphone a lot outdoorsand also always wear sunglasses,then you will definitely prefer the S22 Ultra.And for all of these reasons,I would have to give the win for the displayto the S22 Ultra,although the iPhone 13 Pro Maxdoes have a very nice display.Now, one of the reasons that we have the notchon the iPhone 13 Pro Max isbecause of face ID.Face ID is a very secure method of facial unlockand it works really fast and really, really well.The S22 Ultra also has face recognition.However, this is only using the front-facing camera.It's not using any additional sensorslike the iPhone 13 Pro Max.So it's something that I don't usefor security reasons on the S22 Ultra.However, the S22 Ultra does have anin-display fingerprint scanner.This is the 3D Sonic Gen 2 from Qualcomm.It's the same one we had last yearbut it works really, really well.It's fast.It's very secure.Now, over the past couple of years,my preference has been an in-display fingerprint scannerbecause I've had to wear masks in lots of places.However, Apple has tried to come upwith some solutions for this.Firstly, if you have an Apple Watch,you can unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch,but with an upcoming update,iPhones will still be able to use face IDeven if you have a mask onby recognizing the area on the top of your face.So realistically speaking,I think this is going to come down to personal preference.I think both are absolutely fine.Now let's move over onto the cameras.Hey.Oh, this guy again.Look, it's not the best jobbut somebody's got to do it.Guys, look, I've been looking at the analyticsand I'm going to be honest with you,it's not looking good.It's not looking good.Around 60% of you guys watching are not subscribed.So if you're enjoying this video so far,maybe consider hitting that subscribe buttonand that bell iconso you get notified when we upload new videos.That's it, that's all I'm going to say.Okay, you guys might be getting fed upof seeing Side Saf so many times,but he's really keen for you all to subscribe.So if you haven't already, then maybe consider subscribing.There's going to be lots more Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra contentcoming up here on the channel very, very soon.I've been working nonstop to getas much content out there as possible.So yeah, please do.So cameras.Now I've actually done a detailed SuperSaf Stylecamera comparison between the S22 Ultraand the iPhone 13 Pro Max.It's around 20 minutes longand I cover pretty much all aspectsof the cameras side by side.I'm going to link that video down in the description.So you can go ahead and check that outif you really want to know what the difference is,but to give you a quick summary,we have a very similar camera set up on both devices.We have an ultra wide camera, a primary camera,as well as a 3X Telephoto camera.The S22 Ultra, however, does get an advantagebecause you have a Periscope zoom camerawhich gives you 10 times optical zoomand can go all the way up to 100 times.The iPhone 13 Pro Max maxes out at 15 times.Now, in my experience, when it comes to images,I did lean towards the S22 Ultra more thanksto its versatility.And Samsung also does a lot of processing on their imageswhich some people may not like,but I do like the look of the S22 Ultra images.The iPhone 13 Pro Max however is still the king for video.So if you are somebody who takes a lotof video on your smartphone, the S22 Ultra is goodbut the iPhone 13 Pro Max is just better.You've got excellent dynamic range,great auto focus even in low light situations.Once again, I'm going to linkthe full detail Super SafStyle camera comparisondown in the description and in the cardsso do go ahead and check that outif you really want to see what the differencesbetween these cameras are.Right, now let's move onto performance.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is poweredby the Apple A15 Bionic chip.This has been very smooth.You've got six gigabytes of RAM to go along with that.The S22 Ultra is going to vary depending on your region.In certain regions,you will be getting the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1and in others, you will be getting the Exynos 2200with either eight or 12 gigabytes of RAM.Now it's come to a point where performance is so goodin smartphones that you're literally lookingat seconds of differenceor sometimes milliseconds of difference.So personally speaking,I don't think you're going to have any issueswith either of these.They are both really, really goodand performance also comes down to software.So on the iPhone 13 Pro Max,we do have iOS and we have Android with One UIon the S22 Ultra.Now you guys know I don't gointo an Android versus iOS debatebecause a lot of it does come down to personal preference.I know people don't like itwhen I use the term personal preferencebut that is literally the case.And both iOS and Samsungon One UI are really good with updates.You will get updates longeron your iPhone compared to your Samsung devicebecause the updates come directly from Apple.But Samsung has really been keeping up recently.Now a couple of points I do have to mentionon the software of things isthat the S22 Ultra does take advantageof the larger display much more comparedto the iPhone 13 Pro Max.On the iPhone 13 Pro Max,the icons are very largeand there's really no utilization of that extra space.This is going to look exactly the sameas we have on the iPhone 13 Mini.Now I get that's great for consistencyand Apple does like to keep things consistent,but if you've got such a large screen,I want to be able to make the most of it.On the S22 Ultra,I can make the icons smaller, have an extra column,and you also have features like multi windowwhich will allow you to have two apps openat the same time side by side.I also feel that the S22 Ultra is betterin the way of multitasking.One of the examples I always give iswhenever I'm uploading a story to Instagram,on the iPhone 13 Pro Max,if I then move onto a different app,it's not going to complete uploadingthat video onto my stories.It's just going to stop there in the background.On the S22 Ultra, it's just going to carry on as normaland I don't have to worry about it.On the iPhone 13 Pro Max,I've had lots of situationswhere I've kind of come back a few hours laterand that story has not uploaded.Now I feel this is more down to the software comparedto the RAM because six gigabytes of RAM is still enough,so I hope Apple can improve this going forward.Another big advantage that you geton the S22 Ultra is the S Pen.Now this is enclosed within the deviceand it's also been improved quite massivelywith latency down to just 2.8 milliseconds.It's down from nine millisecondsthat we've had on previous devicesand it's also got lower latency comparedto the Apple Pencil on the iPad Pro.Now, I know an S Pen isn't for everybody,but for somebody like mewho edits image a lot on my smartphoneas well as signs documents and things,this is so, so useful.Unfortunately, you can't get anything equivalentto this on the iPhone.Now for speakers, we do have really good stereo speakerswith Dolby Atmos on both devices.We've got one in the earpiece and one bottom firing.And in my experience,both of these sound really, really good.I don't think you're going to have any issues.My friend Thunder E from Booredatworkhas actually done a detailed speaker test.So if you are really interestedin the differences of speakers,then I'll link his video down in the description below.Now one point I do have to mention is the connectors.So the S22 Ultra does have the more universal USB type-C.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is still using a lightning cable.This is something that I personally find quite frustratingbecause being an Apple userand in the ecosystem with my MacBook Proand my iPad Pro, those devices use USB type-C.However, if I'm traveling,I can't just take the one charger and cable.I do have to also take my lightning cable with mefor the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which is really frustrating.Now I get that there's lots of accessoriesthat still support lightningand it would be a big change,but lightning was great in its time,but it's definitely outdated now.And I think it's timethat Apple should definitely update their iPhonesto have USB type-C for the iPhone 14.However, at this point in time,I'm going to have to give the advantage hereto the S22 Ultra.Let's now talk about the batteries.So we do have quite large batteries on both of these.The S22 Ultra does have a larger physical battery comparedto the iPhone 13 Pro Max.However, size does not matter,I guess it depends on the context,but when it comes to battery sizes,it really does not matter on the actual size of the batterybecause there's lots of other factorsthat do come into play.And in my experience,the iPhone 13 Pro Max is still the champwhen it comes to battery life.Now that's not to saythat the S22 Ultra has bad battery lifeby any means.It's really good and it gets methrough the day absolutely fine,but I would say you do get around 15% better battery lifeon the iPhone 13 Pro Max.However, when it comes to charging,the S22 Ultra does get the advantage.First disclaimer, neither of these comewith a charger out of the box.You will have to buy this separatelybut the maximum charging speedthat can get on the iPhone 13 Pro Max is around 20 watts.On the S22 Ultra,you can get up to 45 wattswhich will give you around 50% chargein 20 minutes compared to a 50% chargein around 30 minutes on the iPhone 13 Pro Max.Both devices also have support for Qi wireless charging.You can get up to 15 watts of Qi wireless chargingon the S22 Ultra.On the iPhone 13 Pro Max,if you use a standard Qi wireless chargeryou can only get a maximum of 7.5 watts.The only way you'll be able to get 15 watts isif you use the proprietary MagSafe charger.Now don't get me wrong.I do like MagSafeand it's great that it just snaps onand you don't have to worry about lining it up on anything.And there's a whole bunch of accessoriesthat also come to the iPhone thanks to MagSafe,but I would've liked for the iPhoneto be able to support up to 15 wattsfor Qi wireless charging, as well as with MagSafe.The S22 Ultra also has reverse wireless charging.This is where you can charge other devicessuch as earbuds and things on the back of the S22 Ultra.I'm going to be real with you,this is something that I don't really use too oftenbut it's a nice to have.Finally, let's talk about storage and pricing.So the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra are availablein the same storage variants:128, 256, 512 gigabytesor a massive one terabyte version.However, the iPhone 13 Pro Max actually startsat a lower price compared to the S22 Ultra.Now, when we do go to the one terabyte option,they're actually at the same price in the US,but the S22 Ultra actually flipsand becomes slightly cheaper here in the UK.Also currently in the US,you can actually get the 256 gigabyte versionfor the price of the 128 gigabyte version.And you can get the 512 gigabyte versionfor the price of the 256 gigabyte option.So that actually puts the device is pretty much neckin neck in terms of price.And you can also get an additional $50 of creditif you use my link down in the description below.This is an exclusive $50 of creditwhich you're not going to find anywhere else.So based on all of that,you will be paying roughly about the same for both devices.So that is the detailed SuperSaf Style comparisonof the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultraversus the iPhone 13 Pro Max.What is your choiceand which one would you pick?Definitely drop me a comment below.Let me know your thoughts.In terms of my opinions, I use both Android and iOSand these are currently my go-to devices on both sides.I think they're absolutely greatand I'd have no problem recommending either of these.Of course, both have their advantagesand disadvantages.On the S22 Ultra,you do have the S Pen, you have a better overall display,faster charging, as well as the Periscope zoom camera.On the iPhone 13 Pro Max however,you do get longer software updates,you get better battery life,and you still get the best video on any smartphone.That's what I think anyway.Definitely let me know what you guys think.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did, then do smash that like button for me.And don't forget, there's going to be lots more content comingup here on the channel with the S22 Ultra.If you don't want to miss it,then do consider subscribing (icon clicking)and tapping (bell ringing)the all notifications button.I'll also leave some related videos linked hereso you can go ahead and check those out.Thanks for watching.This is Saf on SuperSaf TV.I'll see you next time."
4GGedj2pg5A,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,hi everyone Aaron here for zollotech and this  is the samsung galaxy s22 ultra so we'll unbox  this and then we'll also take a look at the galaxy  buds pro as well as the s view flip cover that i  was able to get free with this with the pre-order  now before we get started this video is sponsored  by anker now the first thing is the overall price  it starts at one thousand one hundred and ninety  nine dollars and goes up to one thousand five  hundred and ninety nine dollars that will get  you anywhere from 128 gigabytes to up to one  terabyte of storage however with the pre-order  they were actually giving you the 128 gigabyte  price but giving you 256 gigabytes of storage  it's not expandable and by bumping up that storage  you go from eight gigabytes of ram to 12 gigabytes  of ram so only the 128 gigabyte model has eight  gigabytes of ram we have a few different colors  this is actually the phantom white version we have  burgundy phantom black and green as well and then  there's some exclusive colors such as graphite  sky blue and red let's go ahead and unbox this  so we'll go ahead and flip this over here got my  unboxing knife and we'll see what's in the box so  cut that open here set that aside and let's see  what we've got in here i haven't seen one of these  in person the top was pretty loose fitting  and here is the s22 ultra so we'll set this  aside for just a moment and let's take a look  at what's in the box nothing in the top there  in the bottom we've got well it looks like just  this little tiny box with on the back we've got  our sim card ejector tool and then let's go ahead  and open this up and see what we've got inside  so inside we have a usbc to usbc cable so  your typical samsung cable and then alsoalso we have a quick start  guide and that's about it so  not a whole lot more in here that's all you get  with the phone at least in the united states  so let's go ahead and set this aside now  let's go ahead and take a look around the  outside of the phone but let's first take  off this little plastic piece on the backthere we go and this is a really nice sort of  matte white color so if i bring it up close here  you can see it has this nice matte finish to it we  have an aluminum frame and on the right hand side  we have a millimeter wave antenna we have a power  sleep wake button and then above that we have a  volume rocker on the top we have a microphone  and you can see there's additional plastic here  so there's actually a plastic plastic protective  piece on the top and sort of all around the  device i guess i'll just leave that for now you  can see you can pull that up here on the side  and also on this side we just have aluminum on  the bottom of course we have our sim card tray  let's take a look at that so we'll go ahead and  pop out the sim card tray so we can take a look  at it now you can see there's a microphone right  there you have to be very careful not to put  the sim card ejector tool into the microphone  hole so you don't want to pop the microphone at  all or break it you can see here here's the sim  card tray so it's only got room for one sim card  and you do have an e sim option as well but  no dual sim at least in the united states  and then here is the s pen so it's a black s pen  that goes along with this comes with it feels just  like any other s pen but it fits in here nicely  very similar to a note now we'll talk about specs  in a moment but this doesn't come with a charger  this year but if you need a charger that's where  the official charging partner of zollotech  comes in anker this is the anker 713 charger  nano 2 45 watt and it's part of the anker nano  2 lineup the anker nano 2 is powered by gallium  nitride 2 technology giving it a 20 increase in  operating frequency an innovative stack design and  an upgraded circuit board structure making it 34  smaller than the original 45 watt charger however  this is all without sacrificing a drop of power  and it also has a foldable plug so you've got 45  watts here you can fast charge and the 713 nano  2 45 watt is the perfect charger for the latest  samsung devices it's compatible with samsung's  super fast charging on their latest phones  and the new s8 tab at a full 45 watt of course it  works with the latest iphones macbooks nintendo  switch and more and the full anchor nano 2 lineup  features other gallium nitride 2 equipped chargers  at different wattages and configurations including  the all new anchor 735 charger this is the nano 2  65 watt charger so again with that foldable plug  but you can charge two usbc including a laptop a  new macbook anything like that as well as usb a  so a macbook air would work just fine with this  i'll leave a link to them in the description  below and be sure to check them out there  internally we have a qualcomm snapdragon 8 gen  1 with 12 gigabytes of ram there's also exynos  variants in other countries as well we have  a 5 000 milliamp hour battery again with that  fast charging up to 45 watt usb power delivery  3.0 it also has fast qi charging up to 15 watts  and reverse wireless charging up to 4.5 watts  it has wi-fi 802.11 abgn and ac and 6e as well  with bluetooth 5.2 of course it has 5g and then on  the surface it has gorilla glass victus plus with  a dynamic amoled 6.8 inch display at 3088 by 1440  pixels with a 500 pixel per inch density 120 hertz  display as well as hdr 10 plus also it includes an  under the screen fingerprint sensor when it comes  to the cameras on the front we have a 40 megapixel  selfie camera f 2.2 that can record 4k video up to  60 frames per second and then on the rear we have  four different cameras we have 108 megapixel f 1.8  a 10 megapixel f 4.9 periscope zoom up to 10x  optical 10 megapixel f 2.4 telephoto so that's  a 70 millimeter zoom as well as a 12 megapixel f  2.2 13 millimeter or 120 degree ultra wide and it  can record up to 8k at 24 frames per second  we also have 4k 60 as well as hdr 10 plus  it comes with android 12 along with one ui 4.1 and  four years of software support so that's something  we haven't seen before it also has ip68 ratings  up to one meter for 30 minutes now as far as the  overall size of the phone you'll see the s21 ultra  here on the left it looks very different and it's  a little bit different i actually like the s22  ultra better but this is just my opinion of course  you can see there's no camera bump of course and  i actually like it without the camera bump my  personal opinion but you may or may not like that  it's a little bit wider than the s21 ultra as well  and it feels very similar but maybe a little bit  heavier as far as the note 20 ultra which is most  similar to it you can see that here so we don't  have the camera bump but it looks really good but  i really like this matte finish the camera lenses  stick out quite a bit but you'll see overall it's  most similar to in a note 20 ultra so very very  similar as far as that goes and overall size is  very similar as well so again maybe a little bit  wider there but it's a really big phone and looks  great now let's go ahead and boot it up and get it  set up so we'll turn it on here for the first time  it also has a factory installed screen  protector let's go ahead and remove thatthere we go now we're at the start screen we'll  go ahead and hit start it says insert a sim card  to connect to mobile network i'll just use wi-fi  for now i'll put a sim card in it a little bit  later you have to agree to the terms agree to the  privacy policy and you also have an optional agree  to the sending of diagnostic data we'll go ahead  and hit agree there and then you have permissions  for samsung apps and services so you can agree  or disagree and there's a bunch of different  ones there and we can add a network now now i've  connected to the network it's looking for updates  it says getting your phone ready this may  take a few minutes now we can copy apps  and data from a different phone or not copy  at all we'll just select don't copy for now  we can change that later of course now i've  signed into google we'll set up a fingerprint  and we'll hit continue and we have to put  in a pin of some sort now that i've set up  a pin we'll go ahead and scan our fingerprint so  there we go it's typical samsung fingerprint herewe'll just continue to set it up we'll give  it a moment i've set up a lot of these these  do seem to be the most picky though which  is probably a good thing and we'll go ahead  and hit next so the fingerprint's set up  now it's asking about google assistant  access your assistant without unlocking your phone  you can agree or disagree and it says getting your  phone ready so we'll give it just a moment here  now it continues to take a while to set up and  that's a great background let's see that one more  time it's still setting up here's the fingerprint  sensor it unlocks nice and quick although typical  samsung it's a little bit slower than maybe some  of the optical ones but probably more secure so  i don't really mind that too much now it's saying  you're all set up we'll go ahead and hit finish  and we'll get to the home screen give it just a  moment there and there we go so tap for weather  info we'll hit agree give it just a moment herethere we go let's see what software is  pre-installed so we have facebook of course  let's see if we can delete that looks like  we can we can uninstall facebook on previous  versions it would allow you to disable it but  not uninstall it so i always appreciate that  and we've got the typical samsung apps as well as  regular google apps you can fully customize that  and microsoft apps of course if we scroll here  there we go it's not responding see if we go home  and the phone is completely locked up for some  reason see if we turn it off and nothing's working  so it still looks like it's loading there we go  it didn't respond for a moment for some reason  but let's go back in here you'll see it had quite  the hiccup but now it's working let's go into the  notification shade and it's completing setup so  it could be doing a few things in the background  you'll see it reloaded again and if we go into  settings here under settings under the display  of course we have light and dark mode we'll  switch that adaptive brightness motion  smoothness and it's adaptive up to 120 hertz at  full resolution so we have the screen resolution  we can go up to the highest resolution but it will  use more battery hit apply here and again like you  like i said you can see under motion smoothness  you have adaptive here so that's built in of  course all of that different software and that  nice 120 hertz display and then we have our s  pen with the typical sound there i'll change that  later and it's showing you the different things  you can do with the s pen so smart select you have  translate s pen to text air actions as well as all  of the different things it just said and we'll  hit done so it says enjoy your s pen something  i really like but i don't really use too much but  i do like that it's here and of course we have the  little slide out options on the side here so this  is something i do use and customize quite often  so again we have the s pen it's very responsive of  course and if we go into the camera settings let's  take a look at that so we have focus enhancer  turned on let me put the s21 ultra behind it so  we have something in the frame and maybe we'll  zoom into 10x so it's actually well let's zoom  back out so i can see where we're at it's actually  10 times zoom so let's go ahead and steady  and then we'll take a picture and see what it  looks like so you can see the picture here it's  pretty good it is supposed to be an optical zoom  and we'll set that up later and go back and of  course we have all of the different video options  i mentioned before and let's turn this downthere we goso here we have the different options for full hd  of course we have 8k or 4k at 60 frames per second  there we go and it looks pretty good let's  see what the forward-facing camera is like  so let's swing that around we'll swap swap to the  forward-facing camera go to video switch it to 4k  60. since that's what this video is in and now  i'm recording from the forward-facing camera of  the s22 ultra so this allows you to hear the audio  from it directly instead of this microphone here  and this is the 4k60 video out of the front of  it so let me know what you think about it in  the comments below and so that's the software  typical samsung software what you would expect  really reliable and many people really like  one ui so of course you've got all of that so  what you would expect on a samsung phone now  let's go ahead and take a look at some of the  accessories so these are the galaxy buds pro and  let's go ahead and open these up these aren't  anything really particularly new but they are  something that's really nice especially since  they're included for free when you pre-order or  you have money you can spend towards different  things and that's what i chose to use since  these are pretty good headphones there we go  our earphones so inside the box you'll see here  we have sort of a white color it says sound by akg  if we open it up there's the galaxy buds with the  white sort of surround and a chrome bezel so very  similar to what we have on the new note also here  or the new s22 ultra rather and inside what we  have here is a usbc to usbc or usba cable rather  so you can just reverse wireless charge these  though off the back of the phone and then inside  here we should have some different ear tip size  so there's some different sizes as well  to go along with whatever works for you  and so if we bring over the s22 ultra  let's go ahead and open this up here  and see what happens see if it connects  there we are it noticed them right away  we hit connect and it says asking  for permission while using the app  and it says galaxy wearable so we'll give it just  a moment here and it says downloading software it  was 15 megabytes only took a little bit and it's  taking a moment to get everything set up now it  says for your review you can send diagnostic data  if you'd like we'll hit continue allow so we can  make phone calls with it you have to go through  all these different permissions and give it just  a moment and it says you're all set so we'll  give it a second here and now we can use them  so it's giving us the charge our noise control for  ambient sound or active noise cancellation voice  detect block touches and more so just like you  would expect with the latest line of galaxy buds  i actually like the galaxy buds live as far as  the comfort of them these are pretty nice too and  sound great so we'll set those aside for now and  let's take a look at this case since this is the  s view flip cover and it's a little bit different  than what we had with the last case compared to  say the note or anything else so we'll open this  up and let's cut this this tape here there we goso open it up here like this and  let's see what we've got for the case  and nothing really in the  box except for some paperwork  so just paperwork explaining it lots of  different paperwork there and then here's  the case itself it does come in different colors  as well but i kind of wanted to match the phone  and there we go we'll set all of that aside and  here's the case so the case protects the camera  bumps it looks like has a nice microfiber cloth  lining and gives you an idea of what it looks  like although it does feel sort of like vinyl or  it probably is vinyl but kind of vinyl in a car  so it's not a bad vinyl but it does feel maybe  silicone or vinyl like and then of course cut outs  for everything else so it should protect it pretty  well let's place it in the case here there we go  and there we go as soon as we close the case  you'll see that the time appears so there you  go you've got the time can we interact with it  you can interact with it similar to what you have  on maybe the z flip 3 so you can swipe through no  music playing if you have that and i don't really  have any notifications but we do have music  here so we have that option so you'll see the  cover is like this but if we flip it around the  back because of where they've placed the cutout  it still gives us access to our cameras which  is really nice so you've got that cut out here  and it looks like it was a really well thought out  case it's also antimicrobial so that's something  that's great to see keeps germs off of it and  should help keep it a little bit cleaner so it's  a pretty nice case of course it has metal buttons  as well to turn up and down your volume and then  for the power sleep wake you can still access the  s pen as well so put your finger in there it's a  little bit more difficult but you can get that  as they've left you enough room to sort of get  your finger around or your fingernail behind that  so it's pretty nice case overall so that's it for  the s22 ultra let me know what you think about it  in the comments below it seems like it's going to  be one of my favorite phones as this is a design  i really really like coming from the note 20 ultra  to this is something i really like i actually  kind of like that it doesn't have a camera bump  i know some people don't but i'm pretty pretty  fond of this design overall of course if you're  looking for a charger for your device be sure  to check out anchor in the description below  and of course if you'd like to get your hands on  this wallpaper i'll link it in the description  like i normally do if you haven't subscribed  already though please subscribe and if you enjoyed  the video please give it a like as always thanks  for

2MQ3hkwpkEE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,
Z3T_QWeReWw,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- The iPhone 14 Pro Max is here.It's the best that we have from Apple.How does it compareto one of the best Android smartphones of 2022,the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra?What's up, guys?It's Saf, here on SuperSaf TV.And that's exactly what we're going to be finding outin this video by comparing all of the key differencesof these devices, side by side, SuperSafStyle.Let's initially start off with the build and design.So overall, both are very premiumand both are very good looking deviceswith this matte finish across all of the different colors.The iPhone is available in four colors,a gold, a silver a space black,as well as this deep purple,which I am really liking.The S22 Ultra is also available in four official colors.We've got a white, black, green,which we have here,as well as a burgundy.However, there are some additional exclusive colorsyou can get directly from samsung.com.There's a graphite, a sky blue, and a red.And if you do want to get those colors,you can use my affiliate linkdown in the description below,which will also give you some credit,shameless plug there.Now, for the build,the S22 Ultra has an aluminum frame,the iPhone has a stainless steel frame.So stainless steel,a little bit more premium.But in terms of the glass,we've got Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the S22 Ultra.The iPhone has ceramic shields on the front,and what's Apple called the toughest glasson any smartphone at the back.Now, I'm not somebody who's going to do any drop tests.In my experience,both of these are very premium and very durable.Both devices are also water and dust resistant,we've got an IP68 rating.However, you can submerge the iPhonein water deeper compared to the S22 Ultra.You can do it up to six meters versus 1.5 meters.Now, I'm not sure how useful that's going to be to youif you're taking your device for a swim,but, hey, good to know.Now, with the iPhone 14 Pro Max,it looks pretty much the same as the iPhone 13 Pro Max,so you're not really getting much of a design upgrade,shall we say.The S22 Ultra looks quite a bit differentcompared to the S21 Ultra,so it is a bit more refreshed.We've got flat sides on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,which I really do likebecause it means I can prop this up on a tablewithout having to put anything behind it.The S22 Ultra has symmetrical curved sidesthat go from the back to the front.And even though the S22 Ultra is slightly largerin terms of the height,the width, and the thickness,it doesn't really feel any bigger.And that's also thanks to the factthat it weighs slightly lesscompared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.And that brings us nicely onto the displays.We have beautiful displays on both devices.The S22 Ultra does havea slightly larger 6.8-inch displayversus the 6.7 inch display on the iPhone.Both displays are using OLED technology,so colors are very vibrant.They're both very bright as well,and also very sharp.Now, the S22 Ultra is a tad sharper,it's not something that you're going to noticemuch in your day-to-day,but the iPhone is actually now brightercompared to the S22 Ultra,which is something that I wasn't expecting.We've got a peak brightness of 2,000 nits outdoors,which makes this the brightest displayon any smartphone out right now.Now, that might not be a huge dealfor a lot of people,it is a big plus for me,because I'm always wearing these,and especially when it's a sunny day outdoors,it really makes a difference.And we have an adaptive refresh rateon both devices up to 120 Hertz,making everything really smooth,but both are using LTPO technology,which means that they can go all the way downto one Hertz,which is going to make them more efficient.As well as that,it means that both can have Always On displays.Yes, the iPhone finally hast an Always On display.If you've been watching me here on the channel,you'll know that I've been complainingabout this for many, many years.Now, it's finally here,and it's quite different to the S22 Ultra .So with the S22 Ultra,I do quite like it.You get little icons for notifications,and you can see which apps those have come from.And you do have some customization,you can choose amongst lots of different clock styles,and you can also specify when you wantthe Always On display to come on and off.On the iPhone,you can pretty much switch the Always On display on or off.You can't specify times.It's going to work things out automatically.When you're sleeping,it's going to turn off by itself.If it's in your pocket,it's going to know it's in your pocket,and it's going to switch off.And it does offer a lot of customization,and that's because it's essentially your lock screen,just dimmed down.So including your wallpaper will be displayedon the full Always On,whereas on the S22 Ultra,if you don't want to have an image,it's just going to take up a small section.So both of these have advantages and disadvantages.Personally speaking, I do like them both.Now, looking at the screen to body ratio,we do have a higher screen to body ratioon the S22 Ultra,because we do have slightly smaller bezels,as well as a very small punch out.Now, on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,the bezels are slightly smallercompared to the iPhone 13 Pro Max.And finally, we no longer have a notch,we have what's Apple are calling a Dynamic Island,which is this pill-shaped cutout here in the middle.Now, this does take up more spacecompared to the small punch outs on the S22 Ultra,however, it does bring in lots of new functionality.I've covered this in previous videos,but essentially, you're going to be ableto have music playing here at the top,which you can then long-press an action,or you can have some shortcuts on here.You can have a separate bubble displaying a stopwatch,or if you're on a call.And overall, I am quite liking this Dynamic Island,because it's a different implementationwhich we haven't really seen before.So overall, excellent displays on both devices,some of the best out there in the market.I don't think you can go wrong with either.Traditionally, it's been an easy win for the Samsungbecause the iPhone has generally not been as bright,and it's had that notch,but Apple has really stepped up the display game this year,and I can safely say that this time,it is definitely a draw.Now, one of the reasons why we havethis larger pill-shaped cutout on the iPhoneis because of Face ID.So Face ID is still here,and it works as expected,it's very fast.It also now works with mask,which it didn't do previously,and it's something that I was feeding back for a long time.The S22 Ultra has an under display fingerprint scanner.It's an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner,which in my opinion,is the best under display fingerprint scanneron a mainstream flagship.And realistically speaking,you can't go wrong with either.Both of these work really, really well.Traditionally, I used to favor the S22 Ultrafor the fingerprint scannerbecause I used to have issues when wearing a maskwith Face ID,but now that Apple have updated this,it's not too much of an issue.Right, next up, let's talk about the cameras.Boo, sorry, sorry, man.Before I remind you to subscribe,I just wanted you to let you knowthat we've actually done a SuperSafStyle camera comparisonbetween the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the S22 Ultra.You can check it out after you've watched this video,and also after your subscribeand hit that bell icon.Yeah, that's it from me, sorry.You heard the man.If you haven't already,do consider subscribing if you're enjoying the video.Right, as SideSaf mentioned,if you do want the full breakdown,it's 20 minutes long.You can check out that camera comparison.But to give you a brief summary,we do have an ultra wide camera on both,a primary sensor,which is now a larger size sensor on the iPhone,as well as a three times telephoto camera.The S22 Ultra does havean additional periscope zoom camera,which will give you up to 10 times optical zoom.And generally speaking,I think you can't go wrong with either of these cameras.They both take amazing images and video.With the S22 Ultra,you do get that versatility of focal lens,and that zoom is, I would say, one of the best out there.You also get a better ultra wide camera, in my opinion,with better dynamic range,and you get the best edge detectionthat I've tested on any smartphone.With the iPhone,I think you get an overall more consistent package.With better low light performance,especially in the video.And the iPhone, once again, is still king in videowith great dynamic range,exceptional stabilization,especially with the new action mode,and a very usable cinematic video mode,where it's going to blur the background.I was actually really impressed with this.So once again, excellent cameras overall on both devices.I wouldn't have a problem picking up either of these.You can check out the SuperSafStyle camera comparisonif you want more details,but, I know a lot of you guys are going to ask me,which one of these would I pick upfor an overall camera package for photos, videos,all of the different features?And for me, personally,it would be the iPhone 14 Pro Max.You happy?Right, now, let's move on to the performance.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is poweredby Apple's A16 Bionic chip,the S22 Ultra is going to be poweredby either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1or the Samsung Exynos 2200 depending on your region.You do get more RAM on the S22 Ultra,and in my experience,both of these are amazing,they've got no issues whatsoever,have handled everything that I've thrown at them.Now, I'm not somebody who's going to go detailedinto benchmarks and looking at frame rates,and things like that.I would say that the iPhone 14 Pro Maxwill get a bit of an edgebecause it does have a newer chipset.The S22 Ultra has the 8 Gen 1,which came out earlier.We do now have the 8+ Gen 1 on many other devices.And performance will also come down to the software.And of course we have iOS versus Android.I don't go into debates between these two,and it's come to a pointwhere you really can't go wrong with either OS.I think it's going to come downto which ecosystem you prefer and want to get into.Obviously, with the iPhone,you're going to have things like iMessage,AirDrop, and I do like some of the new featuresthat have come with iOS 16,such as the remove background feature.On the S22 Ultra,it's actually tied in really wellwith the Samsung ecosystem.So if you do have other Samsung devices,you'll also enjoy that experience.Once again, I think this is going to definitely come downto personal preference.I know a lot of you hate it when I say that,but that is literally the case.Now, looking at the speakers,we've got stereo speakers on both devices.There's one speaker in the earpieceand one bottom firing.And both actually sound really, really good to me.Now, I am no audio fellow,but my buddy Thunder E from ""BooredAtWork"" is,and he's actually done a detailed speaker test.I don't want to spoil it too much,but I think the edge does overallgo to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Let's now talk about some of the additional featuresthat you're going to get on both devices,which you're not really going to find on many others.So with the S22 Ultra, you, of course,have the S Pen,which is now enclosed within the device.The Samsung Galaxy S seriestraditionally has not had an S Pen,although on the S21 series,you could buy it separately.They seem to have merged the Note with the S series,and we've got the S22 Ultra.I'm personally a big fan of the S Pen.I love it for just some quick doodling,some photo editing,or if you want to sign a documentwhen you're out and about.I don't use it all the time,but when I do use it,it is so useful to have.You've got a 2.8 millisecond latency,which makes this very, very smooth,and it's such a unique experiencewhich I do appreciate.The S22 Ultra also has DeX support.So you'll be able to wirelessly connect thisto a display.Use your S22 Ultra as a trackpad,and get a desktop experience.Now, the iPhone has some unique features of its own.We now have Crash Detection,so in the unfortunate eventwhere you are in a car crash,the iPhone has sensors,which will detect this,and if you don't respond,it can actually contact emergency serviceson your behalf,which is really, really useful.It also has emergency SOS via satellite.So if you are in the middle of nowhere,you've got no reception,and you need to contact emergency services,it's going to be able to show youwhere the satellites are,connect to them,and send those emergency messages.Now, initially, it's only going to be availablein the US and Canada,hopefully should be coming to other areas soon,and it's going to be included for two years.After which, I believe there's going to besome sort of subscription model.Now, I have to mentionthat we have different ports on these.The S22 Ultra has the more universal USB Type-C,the iPhone 14 Pro Max still has a lightning cable,which I'm not too happy about.I mean, a lot of other Apple devicessuch as the iPads and the MacBookall use the USB Type-C universal port.And it's so annoying when I have to carrya lightning cable when I am traveling.So USB Type-C is definitely the way,and I believe Apple may be forced to use USB Type-Cby Europe very, very soon.We'll see next year,however they say it is still lightning.Now, if you are based in the US,you will no longer have a physical SIM card trayfor the iPhone,you will be having to use eSIM only.It's a pretty straightforward process,but it's something that you'll have to get used to.You do have a physical SIM card tray on the S22 Ultra.Right, now, let's talk about batteries and charging.So the S22 Ultra does have a larger physical battery,but, of course,it's not all about size,depending on the context.And in this context,the iPhone does have better battery life in my experience.I'd say I'm getting around about 20% better battery lifeon the iPhone 14 Pro Max versus the S22 Ultra .Now, for charging, the S22 Ultra does get the advantage,although neither of these come with a chargerout of the box.It does support faster chargingup to 45 watts versus 20 watts.So on the S22 Ultra,you can get a 50% charge in around 20 minutes,whereas on the iPhone 14 Pro Max,that's going to be more like around 30 minutes.Now, both of these do support wireless charging.You have up to 15 watts of wireless chargingon the S22 Ultra.On the iPhone 14 Pro Max,you've got 7.5 watts using a standard Qi wireless charger.But if you do want to use Apple's proprietary MagSafe charger,you can get up to 15 watts.I do like MagSafe,it just snaps on to the back,and you don't have to have a situationwhere you've not placed your smartphoneon a wireless charger correctly.But then again, it is proprietary,it's not just your standard,which I do prefer.The S22 Ultra also does have Wireless PowerShare,so you'll be able to charge things like earbudson the back of the S22 Ultra.And it's not something that I have used much at all,but it might be useful in some situations.Right, finally, let's lookat the storage versions and pricing.So both of these are available in the same storage variants,128, 256, 512 gigabytes,as well as a massive one terabyte version.Now, if you do look at launch prices of the S22 Ultra,it is priced higher in the US compared to the iPhone,but lower in the UK compared to the iPhone.Apple have increased the price for the new iPhone 14quite a bit in the UK and other regions.And I'm not sure why this is,but it is a little bit unfortunate for usliving here in the UK.And with the S22 Ultra,because it has been out for a few months now,you can actually get it lowerthan what it initially came out for.I've seen it for around about 900 to 8,000 poundsdepending on where you get it.And Samsung also are offeringlots of really good trading deals,as well as additional credit using my affiliate linkdown in the description.You don't have to use it if you don't want to,but if you are going to get an S22 Ultra,you may as well.So overall, you will be paying less in most regionsfor the S22 Ultra,and now that it is a few months oldcompared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.And that is the detailed comparisonbetween the iPhone 14 Pro Maxand the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, SuperSafStyle.Personally speaking, I like both devices.I think they've both got their advantages and disadvantages.But it's never been closer.I love to see this competition,and I'm personally going to be using both of these devices.One of my SIM is going to go in the S22 Ultraand the other is going to go into the iPhone 14 Pro Max.That's what I think anyway.What do you guys think?Which one of these would you pick?Do let me know down in the comments below.There's going to be lots more iPhone 14 coveragehere on the channel.If you don't want to miss it,then be sure to subscribe and hit that bell icon,if you haven't already make.Make SideSaf stay.Remember, if you do want to see the full camera comparison,that's going to be linked here,as well as another related video here.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did,then do smash that Like button for me.Thanks for watching.This is Saf on ""SuperSaf TV,""and I'll see you next time."
QBYeX2eMZxQ,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- If you're looking for a premium phone from Samsung,the choice comes downto the Galaxy S22 Ultra and the Z Fold3.But the hard partis that they are very different types of phonesfor very different types of users.So which one is actually better?When we look at the design and the display,the specs are important but they're not as importantas what it's like to actually use each phone.With the Ultra,we're getting an absolutely beautiful slab phonewith curved edges and metal sides.It's definitely a big phone,but I feel like the edges make it comfortable to hold,and I love how clean the lines are with this design.The Ultra also has an integrated S Pen,which I'll get to in a minute.It has a punch hole camera on the frontand a super impressive camera module on the backwith four cameras.The 6.8 inch display on the Ultra is amazing.It's a Dynamic AMOLDED, 120 hertz,Infinity-O, Quad HD+ display.Try saying that fast three times.Well, in any case, the display is big,the colors are vibrant, the image is very sharp,and it's easily one of the best displaysthat I've ever used on a phone.Now, moving on to the Fold3.Clearly we're getting a drastically different designwith two displays instead of one.We start out with a narrow and tall phonewith a 6.2 inch screenthat opens up to reveal a massive internal 7.6 inch display.I like the new hinge's design.It's been updated and it's very smooth,but we're gonna talk about it morewhen it comes to durability.We're getting a pinhole camera on the frontand under-display camera on the insideand a three-camera module on the back,so there's a lot to unpack there.But first, as far as actually holding the phone,the Fold is narrower when it's closedso it might offer a bit more of a secure grip,but it's also practically twice as thick.And you're definitely gonna notice thatwhen you're carrying it aroundor even if you have it in your pocket,and on top of that, it's 42 grams heavier.The difference between the 6.8 inch display on the Ultraand the 7.6 inch display on the Foldmay not sound like a lot,but remember that it's measured diagonally.And because of the aspect ratio of the Fold,we're getting a much larger display.When you're watching content,a lot of this display is relegated to black barsbut there's no question that it's a major advantagefor things like browsing the web, for playing games,and then, of course, for multitasking.Both displays support HDR+, which is great.And on the Fold, we're getting a resolution of 1768 by 2208,1200 nits peak brightness, and 374 pixels per inch.The Ultra has a resolution of 1440 by 3088,an impressive 1750 nits peak brightness,and a higher pixel density of 500 pixels per inch.So if I'm looking for the largest display,that would be the Fold3.If I'm looking at the quality of the display,then I'm gonna give the edge to the Ultra.I just love how this display looks.It's brighter and then the curved edges createa really impressive visual effect.When it comes to biometric authentication,both phones offer face recognitionand both have a fingerprint sensor.The one on the Fold3 is integrated into the power buttonand with the Ultra we're getting an on-display sensor.Both types have worked pretty well for me,but I prefer the on-display sensor on the Ultrabecause it feels more natural for how I hold the phone.Now, before I get to the cameras,I wanna talk about durability because for me,it's more of a factor here than in most phone comparisons.So as far as the build quality, both phones are very solid.Both have aluminum armor framesand the screens are protected by Gorilla Glass Victus.The Fold3 has an IPX8 rating,so you don't need to worry about getting it wet.I've had it out in the rain,I've had it in the snow,and I've also run my own tests without any issues.The Ultra has an IPX68 rating.So in addition to water,you also don't need to worry about dust.Now, so far, I haven't had issues with either phone,but if I'm looking at long-term use,then I'm gonna give the edge to the S22 Ultra.It has less moving parts,I don't need to worry about any potential issueswith a Folding display,and I don't need to worry about any dust gettinginto the hinge mechanism and causing damage.When it comes to the camera system,the Fold3 has a 10-megapixel front-facing cameraand three 12-megapixel rear-facing camera:a wide, an ultrawide, and a telephoto.There's also a 4-megapixel under-display camerawhen you open it up,but the quality isn't great,and I would really only use it as a last resort.The Ultra has the most advanced camera systemthat Samsung offers in a phone.We're getting an impressive40-megapixel front-facing camera,and on the rear camera module,we have 108-megapixel wide camera,a 12-megapixel ultrawide,and then two 10-megapixel telephoto cameras,one with a 3x optical zoomand one with a 10x optical zoom.Ultimately both are premium camera systems.And most people would be happy with the imagesand video they got from either phone.But the Fold3 is using two-year old tech,and if you're looking for the best of the bestwhen it comes to image quality,to resolution, optical zoom, and then low light performance,there's no question that the Ultra is the way to go.The Ultra can also shoot 8K video at 24 frames per secondversus the Fold that caps out at 4K 60.To me, that's more of a flexthan a practical real life advantage,but I still wanted to mention.The one advantage of the Fold has to do with conveniencerather than quality.Because of the folding design,you can use it in Flex Modeand then you essentially have a standthat's built right into the phone,and you can use it to take photos or to shoot video.Now, I wanna talk about the S Pen in a bit more detailbecause it's a perfect exampleof where the specs don't tell you the whole story.You see, both phones offer S Pen support,but only the Ultra actually comes with an S Pen.And the Ultra also has a silo for the S Penso you can store it and take it with you.With the Fold, you need to spend an additional 50 buckson the Fold Edition of the S Penand you need to buy a case that has a slot to store it.Even if you're okay with the additional expense,keep in mind that you're now makinga bulky phone even bulkier.When we look at performance,the Fold3 comes with a very capable Snapdragon 888,and both the 256 and the 512-gigabyte models comewith 12 gigs of RAM.The Ultra comes with the newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip.The 128 gigabyte model comes with 8 gigs of RAMand the 256, 512, and 1 terabyte models comewith 12 gigabytes of RAM.Now, very quickly, in terms of benchmarks,for single core performance,we're looking at 1132 on the Fold3 versus 1245 on the Ultra.And for a multi-core performance,we're looking at 3360 versus 3523.So in both cases, the Ultra comes out ahead.When I tested GPU performance,the Fold3 got a 4702 OpenCL scoreversus 5783 on the Ultra.But what do all these bench numbers actually meanwhen it comes to everyday use?So I can tell you that both phones are extremely fast,and I've not noticed a differencein terms of the responsiveness of the UIor the speed at which apps open.Now, of course, if you give me a choice,I'm gonna go with the more powerfuland more efficient chip on the Ultra.Now, one area where I thought there could be a differencein performance is multi-tasking,and then specifically when running multiple appsat the same time.And what I can tell you is that the advantagesthat I experienced had to do with form factorrather than actual performance.For the most part, with the Ultra,I have one app running at a time.And then every once in a while I would run two,either side by side or one on top of the other.With the Fold3, I use two apps side by sideor one above the other a lot more,and there are even timeswhen I had three apps open at once.With all that,I still didn't experience any type of slowdown or lag,and I'll make sure to continue to cover thisin my long-term reviews.And speaking of long-term,the Ultra has the advantage herebecause Samsung improved their previous level of supportand now offers four years of OS updatesand five years of security updates.Now, if you want your phoneto drive more of a desktop-like experience,then you can use DeX with both devices,connect them to an external display,a keyboard, and a mouse,then you have a powerful dual display setup.Now, of course, this isn't somethingthat most users would dobut it's an extremely powerful feature for those who willand it gives both of these phonesan edge over the competition.Now another important areato consider is battery life and charging.So the Fold3 comes with a 4400 milliamp-hour hour batteryand 25 watts chargingversus a 5000 milliamp-hour batteryand 45 watts charging on S22 Ultra.To me, there's no questionthat the Ultra comes out ahead here.We're getting higher capacity, faster charging,and it has a newer and more efficient chip.These advantages are not just theoretical,and the Ultra easily outlasts the Fold3 in both testingand in my typical day-to-day use.With the Fold, I have to think about battery lifethroughout the day, and I make surethat I use the smaller external display whenever I can.Whereas with the Ultra,I can easily get through a full day of typical usewithout having to worry about it.Of course, one thingthat's always going to drain my battery is gaming.Both phones have plenty of power and RAMto run every game that I tried,including PUBG, Genshin Impact,and, of course, there's no issue with less demanding games.In both cases, gameplay was extremely smooth,and I didn't really notice any benefitsfrom the additional processing powerof the newer chip on the Ultra.When playing PUBG on either phone,you can set graphics to HDRwith frame rate set to Extreme,or you can set graphic to Ultra HDand then frame rate to Ultra.I usually play with either Smooth or Balanced for graphicsand then Extreme for frame rateso I can get a fluid gaming experienceand I can extend a battery life as much as possible.Now, overall, I'm super impressedwith the gaming experience on both,but I'm gonna give the edge to the Foldbecause of the larger display.The Fold is also a better optionif you wanna pair an Xbox controllerand then stream games using the Xbox Game Pass app.You can do this on both phones, of course,but, again, the Fold has a larger displayso it almost feels like you're playing on a small tablet.Now, another important consideration herehas to be the cost.The Ultra starts at 1199 for 128 gigabytesand the Fold3 starts at 1799 for 256.If you wanna compare the same sized storage,then the 256 gigabyte Ultra costs 1,299.Now I absolutely love my Fold3,and I feel like it offers a very unique mobile experience.It's a great device to use for multitasking,for browsing the web, for social media,and, of course, to play games on.So if you're looking for a Foldable device,I absolutely think it's worth the money.And in terms of overall value,I think the Galaxy S22 Ultra is a better choice.It has a faster and more efficient processor,a better camera system, better battery life,it includes an S Pen and has a built-in

gxFZqeB9Ix4,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,the samsung s22 ultra finally a flagship android  that makes me want to move away from my iphone  usually i don't like big phones often because they  don't have any special or unique software features  take the iphone 13 pro max as a prime example it  is bigger and heavier than its counterparts in the  range making it more uncomfortable to use with  one hand and ios 15 has no features that takes  advantage of the extra screen size you can fit the  exact same amount of text and apps on the screen  as on the tiny 13 mini other than better battery  life there really is no reason to buy it over a  13 pro however the samsung s22 ultra has gotten me  excited once again for larger smartphones with the  inclusion of the s pen useful for taking notes and  interesting camera features like the 108 megapixel  main camera with the laser autofocus unfortunately  things haven't been perfect with the s22 ultra  especially when playing games i have installed  countless apps that keep crashing on launch  or if you are lucky to get this far during  the middle of a game i've never experienced  this level of inconsistency before from a samsung  phone that i've reviewed i did update the system  software but this made no difference so hopefully  it's just a minor issue that exists at launch  the display on this phone is incredible it is  fast and smooth with the adaptive 120hz refresh  rate that can go down to just one frame per second  which really helps preserve the battery life last  year's s21 ultra could only reduce down to 10  frames per second furthermore to optimize your  battery usage you do have three resolution options  you can switch between the phone ships at full hd  plus and really for a majority of users i  probably don't see the purpose of changing this  as the image quality is still pretty impressive  however something i haven't seen anyone mention  in their reviews is the vignetting caused by the  curved screen i am a fan of this curved display it  feels great to the touch and looks pretty cool but  down the side of the phone black vignette lines  are visible especially on a solid white background  which may annoy some people what won't annoy some  people is the fantastic outdoor performance this  has to be one of the best phones i have tested for  screen brightness and being visible on a bright  sunny day next up we have the s pen this stores  away inside of the phone much better than on the  fault three that lack the place to put your pen  there are no issues with the tracking and the  latency felt fine for quick doodles and taking  notes the pen can even track and anticipate where  you are going to place the tip on your screen for  writing a note the only issues are the wobble when  trying to write flat on your desk but i am sure  purchasing a case for your phone will probably  resolve this issue in addition you can use the s  pen for smart gestures and one of those includes  using it as a shutter button remote for taking  photos the camera performance just like with any  modern smartphone is more than good there are four  different lens options a 12 megapixel ultra wide  a 10 megapixel three times zoom a 10 megapixel 10x  zoom and a 108 megapixel main camera i found the  s22 photographs to be better than my iphone 13s  and this was even true when comparing night mode  you also have a lot of different video options for  both resolution and frame rates from full hd all  the way up to 4k 60fps there is also an additional  mode that lets you capture 8k video at 24 frames  per second i personally wasn't too impressed  by this footage it didn't look particularly  smooth and it had a bad rolling shutter effect  surprisingly i find the s22 a lot of fun to use  and going back to my iphone it felt very boring  and safe the same old design apple's used forever  and the ugly camera notch is just so 2017. if you  really want to buy an exciting smartphone that is  a little different there's one thing you must know  to avoid buying the wrong phone which is why you  shouldn't ignore this video here which will tell  you everything you need to know about the samsung  fold 3 a great alternative to the s22 ultra
o3FmcGSKSYQ,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"So the Galaxy S22 Ultra leaks and rumors are  heating up as we're only less than 12 days  away from the Unpacked event scheduled to take  place on the 9th of February. One of the most  compelling things about the Galaxy S22 Ultra is  that it will be a successor to the Galaxy Note  meaning we'll see an integrated S Pen along with  a wider display and squared-off design. But that  isn't the only reason people are excited  for the S22 Ultra, the camera is another  big reason. Even though there are no major  camera hardware changes Samsung according  to the rumors has managed to improve the quality  substantially. One of the aspects is the night  mode. Samsung themselves said that the S22 Ultra  will feature the best in class night photography.  And to promote that they have released a  new trailer with messages reading ""Break the  rules of light"" and ""Breakthrough the night"".  A South Korean tipster gives more insight on this  saying that the time taken for the night photos  meaning the time the camera shutter remains open  is similar to the S21 Ultra. But despite that,  the image quality is so much better that the S22  Ultra is now in its own league when it comes to  night photography much better than what Apple and  Google currently offer. He even mentioned that  in night mode, the average time taken by the  handset is 3 seconds under normal conditions  and 6 seconds when it's pitch black.   Moving on, we also have a complete  specification leak of all the S22 variants.  If you've been following the S22 updates then  nothing here should be really surprising. But  it's good to see everything compiled in one  place which will give you a better idea.  One thing I would like to point out is that  even though all the S22 handsets now have  LTPO displays, which is awesome, but they are not  totally the same. I mean the display on the S22  Ultra is a true LTPO that can go from 1Hz to 120Hz  while on the S22 and S22+, it can go from 10Hz to  120Hz which honestly won't make a huge difference  but I thought you should know. Either way, all the  S22 handsets will have brighter displays, and  here's how it compares to the S21 handsets.   A couple of days ago we also got the official  European prices but we still have no idea how  these handsets will be priced in the US. Well,  a new survey sent out by Google themselves might  give us an idea. According to the survey, the  S22 will be priced at $899, 1099 for the S22+,  and $1299 for the S22 Ultra. Basically, a $100  increase compared to the S21 variants. Now,  keep in mind that this is not an official leak.  It's just a survey conducted by Samsung to test  the user's reaction to these prices. I still think  the US prices will match the Euro prices which  means 849 for the S22 and $1249 for the S22 Ultra.  We'll know soon enough on the 9th of February.   Also, you might know already that Samsung  is offering $50 of credit for preregistering  the S22 in the US. Well, it seems Samsung is  offering higher discounts for some countries.  Notably, Sweden is getting a 100  euro discount which is the highest  we've ever seen. The Netherlands on the  other hand is getting 50 euro credit.  Of course with that said for  all the latest updates on the  S22 be sure to subscribe and as always I'll  see you tomorrow...peace out  "
ewQQLD3jlsA,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,[Intro Music Plays]hey everyone this is km frequency and this time  we got the galaxy s22 ultra an upgrade from the  s21 ultra of last year the only question is  how much of an upgrade compared to last year  the s22 ultra doesn't seem all that different  except for the shape and the added s-pen silo  to make it more akin to the note 20. however even  with the similarities to one samsung or another  that has to stop the s22 ultra from trying to  distinguish itself in some other ways i'll go into  some specifics with the s22 ultra and anything i  noticed with my time using it although the focus  will be the most significant changes from the s21  to the s22 we got a few upgrades in the camera  some thoughts on the battery life and the comeback  of the s pen so let's take a look at some of those  ways big or small to see if the upgrade from the  s21 to the s22 was worth it don't forget to click  the bell like and subscribe if you end up liking  this video or any other content on the channel  with that out of the way let's get into it looking  at the galaxy s 22 ultra some people will find  it highly familiar to the galaxy note 20 ultra as  that box like shape with sharp edges and a thicker  body to hold that s pen in place i mean take a  quick look at both phones together you almost  can't tell the difference between the two until  you look to the back in which the differences  become more noticeable instead of having that  raised corner the lens are now protruding directly  from the back and surprisingly enough i like this  design better because of that cleaner look but i  did have a soft spot for the two-tone on the  s21 ultra they come in a wide array of colors  in black burgundy green and white including some  samsung website exclusive colors like graphite sky  blue and red the samsung exclusive colors sell out  often but they often restock too so you shouldn't  have too much trouble getting them for storage  sizes you have your typical 128 gigabyte to one  terabyte models and the one weird difference on  samsung's part was a decision to make 12 gigabytes  of ram only available on the 256 gigabyte and  up the 128 gigabyte version only has eight a  significant difference from the galaxy s 21 ultra  which had 12 across all storage sizes so if you're  upgrading from the s21 and opting for the 128  gigabyte version it's going to feel like you're  moving backwards i don't see samsung's plan here  because the pixel 6 pro has 12 gigabytes of ram at  8.99 so the price shouldn't be an issue the only  reasoning i can see is that they're trying to push  it to the 256 gigabyte model samsung usually has  some fantastic trading offers so if you choose to  upgrade the hurt is alleviated a bit if not you're  looking at 1200 for the 256 gigabyte model which  is steep to buy out right one of the ways they try  to justify that premium is in the display samsung  amoled displays have a hard time being knocked out  of the number one spot making it even harder with  each upgrade to the galaxy s line the 6.8 inch  display on the galaxy s22 ultra is better than  the s21 including the 120hz refresh rate being  transferred over as well now are those differences  night and day i don't think so but there is enough  to notice some mark improvements especially the  screen brightness and direct sunlight if you  leave on adapter brightness as soon as you  enter the sunlight the brightness will kick onto  the max the only difference is that with adaptive  brightness off you can take the high brightness  one step further and an extra brightness mode  making it extremely easy to see the screen as  if you didn't have it in direct sunlight at all  you should never have a problem seeing this phone  in the daylight including the display retaining  its color and saturation amazingly well i usually  don't mention cameras in my reviews because i'm  not a photography expert i do have a fantastic  photographer in my family but it's not me  if you didn't know i take all the footage of these  videos with my phone so cameras are essential here  and i'm learning but not to the level where i can  tell you how good they are some people have been  asking about cameras in some of my other videos  so i thought i'll briefly review some of the  improvements i noticed moving from the s21 ultra  to the s22 i saw some big ones when shooting my  videos with them and maybe you'll be able to  apply it to your purchase decisions okay now  let's talk about these improvements the immediate  thing i noticed when shooting videos was autofocus  on the s21 a lot of the time things would be  entirely out of focus when trying to get something  centered it was generally just slow to react on  the s22 the problem was pretty much eliminated  for me when trying to move an object in and out  of a frame the camera instantly picks up on it and  focuses immediately video recording in general  has some nice improvements the telephoto lens  appears to have some increased detail resulting  in a more precise and crisper image most of the  time the over sharpening on any still photos and  video has been reduced from previous ultra devices  giving it a softer and more accurate look shutter  lag still comes up when you use portrait mode or  take some pictures in quick succession so  i don't think much changed on that front  still photo quality is fantastic here and any  other issues don't diminish it all that much  anyone using the standard mode will be taking some  great pictures individuals using the pro mode can  have their photography looking fantastic not much  has changed when discussing android and when you  want on the s22 ultra you still have endless  customization features and numerous varied  settings so you'll feel right at home if you ever  had a samsung device adding widgets and changing  the look of the lock screen are all there they  made one edition by adding the ability to create  smart widgets which allows you to make stackable  widgets that you can scroll through to save some  space on the home screen and give it a cleaner  look there's also a bit more emphasis on quick  share and airdrop equivalent for samsung in which  you can transfer files across samsung devices like  the galaxy tab s8 plus if that individual doesn't  have a samsung or android device you can share  it as a link in the form of a qr code in addition  like with the galaxy tab you can run samsung decks  and connect it to an external monitor controlling  the whole thing with your finger or the s pen you  get the whole desktop like experience like you  would with the galaxy tab while samsung dex is  running you can use some functions of your phone  like normal no phone calls or anything add a  couple crashes trying to make those calls but text  and browsing internet is okay as well as running  youtube and others if you feel like connecting  it to your pc as a mirror display you can do that  with samsung flow just install samsung flow on  your pc and s22 follow the steps and voila mirror  display and if that screen is touchscreen you can  control your phone from there too along with smart  view for use with any other wireless display there  are a few exceptions but in most cases it works  99 of the time there is a way to connect to an  external display for pretty much any one situation  or setup the s pen is back neatly tucked into silo  and ready to click right out when you need to jot  a quick note and want more precise control over  your phone writing with it can feel a bit weird at  first but it's something you get used to and the  incredibly low input lag certainly helps with that  honestly though i don't use it to take notes as  much as i thought i would in the beginning i would  occasionally use it to make quick notes but over  time i felt like it was easier to use my finger  to type when i needed to get some thoughts  out or just set up a simple shopping list  it could be because i'm so used to the galaxy  s20 and the 21 ultra not having it that i feel  like i don't need it and i'm going to try  to make it a goal to use it a bit more often  nonetheless the s pen and all his base features  such as unlocking your phone using it as a shutter  button for the camera raising or lowering the  volume and playing and pausing music and videos  are all here the shutter button for the camera is  the one i use the most before i would have to use  these third-party remotes that only work 25 of the  time but no longer even if you may not use it all  that much the s pen is always there when you need  it for that much added convenience also just like  with the s21 ultra the stylus attached to the s22  can be used for the galaxy tab and the galaxy tab  s pen can also be used for the s22 so even if you  lose one or the other i don't feel like switching  pins when moving between devices you can feel  safe using them on either one you just have  some mismatched sizes that may be tricky to write  with there's not much to say about the speed and  overall performance of the galaxy s22 ultra there  hasn't been many variations in how phones perform  nowadays from year to year across the s20 ultra  the s21 and the s22 i've not seen much difference  every time i upgraded it's just as fast and smooth  as it's always been the only exception would be  what i was talking about earlier in the review  about the 128 gigabyte having only 8 gigabytes of  ram may not be able to keep as many apps in memory  as the other storage sizes in addition it may not  be able to run as many apps simultaneously when  using dex the extra ram makes a big difference  especially when we are discussing running android  as a mobile operating system apart from that one  ui runs as smoothly as it always has allowing  you to make as many changes as possible from  everything to the lock screen and the home screen  for people who find maximum performance necessary  snapdragon gen 1 can run most everything you throw  at it most graphic intensive apps run well and  i have encountered too many issues for most apps  out of the google play store using the fingerprint  reader to unlock the phone is fast and responsive  never waiting on a delay the speed of the sensor  improves with every iteration but it never hurts  to add that extra fingerprint for more accuracy  generally performance isn't something to worry  about for those upgrading or picking up a galaxy  device for the first time i'm going to be honest  the battery is the one area i was disappointed in  battery performance being different is not what  i imagined when i first upgraded especially when  both the s21 and the s22 had the same capacity  at 5000 milliamp hours on my s21 i was averaging  about eight to nine screen on time on my s22 i  got a screen on time of five to six this is a  drastic difference from what i was getting on  the previous model when to be honest the two  phones aren't entirely different for one another  the only thing that changed with the addition of  the s pen and a brighter screen only when put  to the max which i rarely ever do unless i'm  outside in direct sunlight so i don't understand  the significant difference in battery performance  the s22 ultra does manage to get through a full  day of battery when i'm doing general smartphone  tasks like browsing the internet texting and  making phone calls all those tasks still only  resulting in the five to six maybe seven hours  screen on time i was constantly getting it's  not terrible for a smartphone doing as much as the  s22 does but for what is supposed to be a lateral  upgrade the battery doesn't pass the test at all  you would think efficiency would increase going  from one to the other but not in this case it's  incredibly average and not what you would expect  out of a 5 000 milliamp hour battery standby time  is good at about 11 to 13 hours per day i never  felt like the battery was constantly draining as  i left my phone for minutes or hours at a time it  would drop a few percentages but not enough for me  to feel like i may need to grab my charger later  but that's the standby time screen on time was  my only issue for me coming from last year's s21  for those of you that are upgrading from the s21  ultra to the s22 you may have something to think  about before moving on to the next one if battery  is a major concern for you the galaxy s22 ultra is  a great device that feels like it takes two steps  forward then two steps back while the improvements  may not be as massive to most i believe the s22  ultra is one of the top android devices to get  while the camera enhancements and the note  features coming back are great being the two  steps forward for most people those improvements  might not be enough and when you circle the  discussion back to the battery it just feels like  it effectively takes that one step back especially  the 128 gigabyte only having 8 gigabytes of  ram effectively making it another step back  essentially bringing it back to where it started  at the galaxy s21 ultra i wouldn't blame anyone  for feeling they should keep their current device  and wait for the eventual s23 if you're looking  to grab all those note features they're gonna drop  me from the s21 ultra or if you may be looking to  jump from ios to android you'll still be getting  one of samsung's best smartphones to date my  opinion would be to try to grab that 256 gigabyte  model if you can for the ones making the jump from  iphone to samsung you're in for an amazing fresh  new experience anyone who is content planning  upgrading from the s21 ultra you're looking at  more of the same but just a little bit better  emphasized a little honestly though it feels like  i pretty much got the same phone with a few pros  and cons swapped for one another which for me  felt a bit underwhelming if you liked this video  make sure to give it a like comment and think  about subscribing i'll see you on the next one
Mgb9mRd3MPc,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- With the official Samsung Galaxy Unpacked eventweeks away, we pretty much already know everythingthere is to know about the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.What's up guys, Saf here, on SuperSaf TV, and as always,we're going to be breaking down all of the informationthat we have available,so you guys know exactly what to expect.This video is sponsored by HP.Stay tuned to find out how you can print sustainably,with products available to purchase from staples.co.uk.So as we've had in previous years,there will be three Samsung Galaxy S devices.This year there's going to be an S22, an S22+ and an S22 Ultra.Now in this video, we are just going to be concentratingon the S22 Ultra, which is the flagship device.And the first thing you'll notice right awayfrom all of the leaks and rumors, is that the S22 Ultralooks quite different to the S22 and the S22+,this is a fresh design.Samsung introduced a new design for the S21 Ultra last year,where the camera module kind of blends into the edges,something that I really do like.And although this design has been continued on to the S22and the S22+, the S22 Ultra has somethingthat Samsung hasn't really done before.We've got all of the camera modules separate,and they are almost flush with the back of the device.But more interestingly, the S22 Ultranow looks like it's got more of a boxier design.You guys know where I'm going with this.Samsung traditionally has more of a boxier designedfor their Note series, but as you may already know,last year, we did not have a Note device.Now this was for many reasons,one of which was the chip shortage.But if we do look at previous years,the Samsung Galaxy S line has been getting moreand more close to the Note line,with the S Pen really being the differentiator.On the S21 Ultra last year, it did have supportfor the S Pen, although this was somethingthat you'd have to buy separately.With the S22 Ultra, it looks like we are getting the S Pen,but it will be included, and it will be housedwithin the device itself, like we've had on the Note series.And Samsung has just now teased the mergingof the Galaxy Note series into the S series,which all but confirms this.Now for somebody like me, who's a big fanof the Note series, I'm very happy about this.Essentially it's a Note device, but it is now namedan S22 Ultra, which I'm absolutely fine with.From the leaked info around, the size,it looks like this will be very similar in sizeto the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra we had last year,a little bit thicker.And it will have an aluminium framewith curved glass panels, both on the front and the back.The front panel will be Gorilla Glass Victus+according to rumors, this will be a step abovethe current Gorilla Glass Victus we have.The S22 Ultra will be available initially in four colors,a black, a white, a bronze,which is similar to the Note20 Ultra we've already seen,but also a new green, which looks really good.The S22 Ultra will also have IP68 water and dust resistance.Now the S Pen will be improvedcompared to what we've had in previous years.And it's rumored to have a latencydown to just 2.8 milliseconds, which is amazing,a much lower latency compared to the S Pensthat we've had in previous years.And if we move over to the front,the display actually looks very similarin terms of the design to the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra.So we've got small bezels with a center punch outfor the front facing camera.Now, although the design looks overall the same,the technology has been improved.So we've got LTPO technology going all the waydown to one Hertz and all the way up to 120 Hertz.Now this is going to be able to switch quickercompared to what we've had in previous years,making it more efficient.We're going to have a Quad HD+ resolution.I mean, Samsung is the best when it comes to displays,so I can only expect that this will be one of the,if not the best display on the market when it releases.And we've not really had much informationabout the in-display fingerprint scanner,but we can expect this to be the ultrasonic Gen 2,or maybe an improved version of it.Right, now before we move on to the cameras,a quick thanks to our sponsor for this video, HP.Did you know that original HP ink cartridges are designedwith the planet in mind, for easy recycling and less waste?A 100% of the original HP toner cartridgesand 82% of the original HP ink cartridgesare developed from recycled materials.Since the year 2000, 256 million pounds of recycled plasticshave been used to make new ink toner cartridges, and HP keptover 4.7 billion plastic bottles out of landfills and oceansby upscaling them into new HP ink cartridges.And with the HP+, for every page you print,HP protects or restores forests in equal measure.I love what HP are doing for the environmentand sustainability, and I'm so glad to partner with them.If you want to find out more about HP sustainability,then do check out the link in the description below,with products available to purchase from staples.co.uk.Now for the cameras, as far as we can see,the overall setup is going to be quite similarto what we had on the S21 Ultra last year.So a 40 megapixel selfie camera at the front,and then a quad rear facing camera set up,with a 12 megapixel ultra-wide camera,108 megapixel primary camera with a super clear lens.And two telephoto cameras, one with three times optical zoomand the other with 10 times periscope optical zoom.Now, although the specs are overall the same,we should be having some improved sensorsalong with the new image signal processesthat are going to come with the new chipset,so this should give us improved imagery.And for video, it is rumored that the S22 ultrawill support 12-bit HDR recording,this will give you around 64 times more colorscompared to what we had previously.Now, personally speaking for me, the Samsung Galaxy seriesgenerally has the best video on the Android side,so I'm very excited to see what the S22 Ultra would offer.And of course, we're going to be doing lots of SuperSaf-stylecamera comparisons as soon as the S22 Ultra is in-house.If you want to make sure you don't miss any of that coverage,then do subscribe and hit that bell icon.Right, moving on, what is the S22 Ultra going to be powered by?Well, we're going to have a similar situationlike we've had in previous years, there will bea Qualcomm chipset, as well as an Exynos chipset.The Qualcomm version, pretty obvious,it will be the Qualcomm Snapdragon8 Gen 1,this is the flagship chipsetfor most Android devices this year.But on the Exynos side of things,we're likely to have at the Exynos 2200.This is a four nanometer chip with AMD RDNA 2 architecture,based on Samsung's Eclipse GPU.Now, in terms of which one of these is going to perform better,we've seen some leaked benchmarks,but I try not to go towards benchmarks.Generally, the Qualcomm version has been superior,but maybe that's going to change this year.We'll be doing lots of tests,and I will try to get both of these devices in-house,so we can do some more experience-based comparisons.And for storage, the S21 Ultra last yearcame in three options, 128, 256, and 512 gigabytes.It is rumored that the S22 Ultrawill also have a one terabyte option.And unfortunately there will not to be a micro SD card slot.We didn't have that last year, and it's not going to makea come back to this year unfortunately, I'm sorry.Stereo speakers are expected, there's going to be onein the earpiece and one bottom firing.For software, it will be Android 12 with One UI 4.1.One UI for me, it's personallyone of my favorite skins on Android.You've got great one-handed usage,and Samsung has actually been keeping on top of updates,so this is something that I'm definitely excited about.Right, for the battery, from all the leaks and rumors,it looks like we will have the same size battery as we hadon the S21 Ultra, this will be around 5,000 milliamps.Now, generally, Note devices have a slightly smaller batterybecause you need space for the S Pen, but it looks likeby making the device maybe slightly thicker,they have managed to get the same size batteryas we had on the S21 Ultra, which is great.The S21 Ultra in my experience generallydid have very good battery life,so I'd expect the same with the S22 Ultra.Now for charging, it looks like we will have improved45 Watts wide charging available.This will have to be bought separately however,because as we had with the S21 ultra, there will not bea charger included out of the box with the S22 Ultra.You're going to get those slim boxes, which are now a fee.Wireless charging will also be supported,this will be just at 15 Watts,so not as fast as some of the competition out there.We can also expect reverse wireless charging powershare,so you can charge other devices like earbuds and thingson the back of the S22 Ultra.Finally, when can you officially hear about the S22 Ultra?Well, the current date for Unpackedis rumored to be the 9th of Feb.There was some reports saying the 8th of Feb,but most recent ones are saying 9th of Feb.And once the S22 Ultra has been officially announced,you can expect it to go on salearound a couple of weeks after that date.For pricing, we've only had leaked pricing in Euros,which is similar to the launch price of the S21 Ultra.And considering that the S21 Ultra came in at around $1,200,I'd expect the S22 Ultra to come in around about that price,maybe slightly lower, maybe slightly higher.And that's everything that we know about the S22 Ultraso far, I mean, it's pretty much everything.What do you guys think of itbased on all of these leaks and rumors?Personally, I'm very excited.Do let me know what you guys think in the comments below.Remember, as soon as the retail units of the Ultrais in hand, I'm going to be doing lots more coveragehere on the channel, so please do not forget to subscribeand hit that bell icon.I hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful.If you did, then do smash that like button for me.And if you want to see some more related videos,they will be linked around here.Thanks for watching.This is Saf, on SuperSaf TV, and I'll see you next time."
QZ_WXyptNDE,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,yes yes it's all very pretty a fancy folding phone  with all the latest tech apart from the camera  but what has it really been like to own a galaxy's  evol 3 in 2022 has it been all this hyped up to be  or has it been completely impractical and  a colossal waste of money let me answer  that for you so the default three is a beautiful  phone there is no denying that and it's actually  not as impractical as you might first think but  i do have a confession to make and it's something  that i'm not particularly proud of sometimes i  like to look at other phones sorry listen it's  not that i don't like it and it's not that i'm  particularly bored of it it's just that the z-fold  three sits in a bit of a funny place for me on  one hand is a complete productivity powerhouse  and then on the other it's a bit of a pain in the  ass why you might ask well it's big and it gets  even bigger when you throw some clothes on it to  the point it's too big annoyingly big then there's  also the fact that it's fragile or at least it  feels fragile i've not thrown this phone on the  sofa once since getting it i treat it like a brand  new phone every day which is great in some respect  but i'm just too scared to break it and yes the  7.6 inch screen has been a godsend multitasking is  easy games look fantastic and when you're really  done for the day it serves as a lovely little  pocket cinema screen but then the cover screen  aspect ratio really does annoy me a lot instagram  gets all squished youtube shorts get chopped up  and a lot of apps do tend to get just as upset as  i do with the fold three's cover display do  you see what i'm getting at here all aboard  the z-fold three seesaw and a seesaw would be a  really good analogy to describe the z-fold three  and what determines what side that seesaw is going  to come down on is you and i cannot stress this  enough you really do need to think about whether  or not you can fit this phone into your lifestyle  because i can assure you is not going to fit into  everyone's life if you travel a lot for example  go out to festivals or live near a beach then  probably not if you work a lot commute or just  live a slightly less adventurous lifestyle then  perhaps this is a phone for you so i'll leave you  to think about that but in the meantime how has  the galaxy z43 been as a phone over the past five  or six months for me well despite all the things  i've mentioned at the start it's actually been  pretty damn brilliant performance isn't something  you should ever have an issue with battery life  at first to me felt pretty awful if i'm being  honest but now it's getting me to the end of  the day then there's one ui 4.0 and android 12  which complement the phone really nicely it all  feels buttery smooth and the camera while the  camera sucks no it doesn't suck it's actually  a pretty good camera but i think the point that  reviewers have been making is that if you pay 1600  1700 for a phone you kind of expect the latest and  greatest camera tag you don't get that here at all  but we'll talk more about the camera later on now  ignoring the obvious size issues with the galaxy  z43 the design is actually very nice it does take  some getting used to to type on the front cover  display but now i make just as many mistakes  as i would with a regular candy bar phone then  there's a placement of the volume rocker and the  fingerprint scanner in my opinion is very sensible  it's very easy to use and because of the slimmer  design of the cover display or the z4 when it's  folded up in your hand it's very accessible very  easy to use i do miss having an under display  fingerprint scanner i will admit but it's not the  end of the world and i have got used to using this  physical fingerprint scanner on the side of  the z-fold 3. one thing that has really upset  me with the design side of the z-fold 3 though  is this this is the phantom green z-fold 3. i  don't think i really need to say anything else on  that subject anyway i think you see my point now  you could argue that it's all a bit hit-and-miss  when it comes to the galaxy z43s design  and actual practicality but as i said earlier  you need to decide whether you can fit this phone  into your lifestyle or not so if you  are thinking about taking the plunge  what else makes this phone special is it just the  folding mechanism that makes this phone so fancy  and sought after or is there other things going on  under the hood well let's take a look at the specs  since the z-fold 2 there have been numerous  improvements that will have got those  waiting on the sidelines to take the plunge make  that all-important decision the first being the  ipx8 water resistant it was a fantastic addition  to the zfo3 and was a sole feature that made me  think okay now i'm ready for this phone but there  is no dust resistance which is a big drawback for  some and that's why earlier i made that joke  about going to the beach this is quite a big  problem considering there are some moving parts  to this phone now specifically the hinge and i am  personally convinced that there is a bit of dust  stuck under the display perhaps it's gone through  the cracks in the hinge i'm not sure how it got  there but if you look on reddit and other forums  you'll see that a lot of other people have been  reporting similar things although this is a big  shame we did get gorilla glass victus which  is supposedly a more durable yet more flexible  material and we also have that nice aluminum or  aluminium material for the chassis and the hinge  which does give the galaxy d43 a bit more of a  premium luxury vibe it does feel really good in  the hand build quality aside we've got things  like the silky smooth 120 hertz refresh rate  on both the cover display and the inner display  this is something that i said in my initial review  or first videos before the z43 came out that i  didn't think i was gonna be too bothered about but  since moving to 120 hertz and then picking up my  note 10 which is at 60hz i kind of get why 120hz  is so important to some people on the subject  of displays i must tip my hat to the beauty  of the inner dynamic amoled display that along  with the very impressive dual firing speakers  make the galaxy z43 a perfect media consumption  device i suppose you could even compare it to an  ipad mini of sorts except with better resolution  and that is the beauty about the z-fold 3 or any  other folding phone yes it is expensive but if  you think about it you're essentially getting  two-in-one you're getting a phone and a tablet  that fits in your pocket bearing all this in  mind i do really want to highlight the impressive  specifications of this phone we won't go through  all of them but the main things to note are 12  gigabytes of ram and that snapdragon 888 chip  which has been an absolute beast to be honest i  can honestly say this is the first phone that i've  never had an issue with any stuttering any pauses  nothing has indicated that it's been struggling  with performance also on the performance point  it's been the first phone where multitasking  has really made sense to me with previous smaller  phones there's always been the option for pop out  windows and split screen modes yet they haven't  really appealed to me because they've been  virtually pointless because the phone screens  are so small now though i can really make the  most of these features and further to this i have  to commend samsung on the excellent execution of  their multitasking options i regularly use all of  these features most noticeably when i'm scripting  and doing research at the same time it means i can  have my document on one side and then my browser  open on the other side this paired with apps such  as trello for example make the galaxy z fold 3  the perfect phone for entrepreneurs and busy bees  who need to stay productive all the time now one  thing i do have an issue with with the galaxy z  fold 3 is the s pen it's great that the support is  there and it is quite special using it on that  inner display especially if you're an artist  call me picasso but for one you have to buy it  separately and do bear in mind that the galaxy z43  is costing you almost 2 000 for a phone  or nearly 2 000 pounds if you're in the uk  and now you've got to add this extra accessory on  top which to me is quite an important feature then  secondly there's nowhere to store it and then  lastly you can't use it on the front display  all of these things have had me eyeing up the  galaxy s22 ultra recently and has made me miss my  note 10 plus so question of the day if money was  no object would you pick right now a galaxy z43  or a galaxy s22 ultra let me know down in the  comment section and slap that subscribe button  while you're at it now we've joked and made a  reference to the z43s camera setup several times  in this review and the general consensus of  the z43s camera setup is that it's bad it's not  think s21 not s21 ultra just s21 so the cameras  are good as i mentioned earlier they're not what  you would expect for paying such a hefty price  tag for a phone and yet the photos aren't half  bad at all they're definitely samsung they've  got that beautiful strong color and contrast  with sensible sharpening and good dynamic range  you've also got a nice selection of focal lengths  to choose from and you can even record at 60fps  4k with the stabilization features turned on  i'd argue that that's more than enough for a phone  especially since most media is shared and consumed  on phones nowadays and you are lucky to find  a phone that has a 4k capable screen one of my  biggest concerns with the galaxy z4 was actually  the under display camera on the inner display  now it is quite low resolution in comparison  to other phones and this was what personally  put me off but actually when you get it out  you really can't see a difference and it's just  fine for doing video calls or anything like that  and because the z fold 3 is a folding phone you  can always just flip out your front screen and  use your actual main camera as your selfie camera  and that is the beauty about it you really don't  actually need that under display camera and when  you do use it you're just using it to chat your  mates on facebook or whatever and quality really  isn't that important anyway the full three has  been a delight for me there's no denying that and  although i've got a perfectly good note 10 plus  really wanting me back i don't think that i could  go back to a candy bar phone now yes i do look  at other phones i've of course had my eye on the  latest s22 ultra that looks like a fantastic phone  but there's something about having a foldable  phone for someone who is a content creator  a bit of a workaholic and a gamer that just  really fits into my lifestyle and does me some  justice the only thing that would make me change  from a folding phone now is if samsung or another  reputable company comes out with a moldable phone  i think moldable phones will take over foldable  phones eventually because they're going to be  more practical you can look to the oppo x4 an  example of what that might look like anyway as  always let me know in the comments what you think  of the galaxy z43 and if you did enjoy the video  leave a like and subscribe to the channel for more  content for now though i've been alex this has  been take it easy thank you so much for watching  and hopefully i'll see you in the next one
erJPom2eBgg,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"Few brands have kept faith in the stylus like  Samsung and, in the process, the company has  fixed note-taking to a great extent. Some type out  important notes using Google Docs while others jot  down on paper and even on the backs of napkins.  The stylus had no place in Steve Jobs world  but now even Apple wants to make its Pencil  stylus stand out. Of course, the Galaxy Note  deserves all the credit for popularising this  whole stylus concept. Even though the name Galaxy  Note is probably no more but the handset itself  lives on in the form of Galaxy S22 Ultra.  Now, Samsung has been increasing the functionality  of the S Pen over the years. And one of the key  improvements is the latency of the pen. The  latency on the original Note was pretty bad but  it improved over the years to the point Samsung  has reduced the screen latency down to just 9ms.  It's in line with Apple pencil which also has  the same latency. Now with the Galaxy S22 Ultra  Samsung wants to take the latency game to a whole  another level as Ice Universe mentions that the  handset will have a mere 2ms latency. If you don't  know what latency on the S Pen is, it's basically  the time taken for the touch input to register.  So 2ms touch latency is something unheard of  and would be a great achievement which for the  end-user means the writing and drawing on the S22  Ultra feel more precise and natural literally  like you're writing on a piece of paper.   Now, even though Samsung didn't mention it  anywhere but some people say the latency of  the S Pen on the Z Fold 3 is also 2ms but I  don't think that's true. Because I've tested  the S pen on the Z Fold 3 and it feels about the  same as the Note 20 Ultra. So with the S22 Ultra  Samsung is indeed going to break the latency  record and eager to see how that feels in real  life since 9ms already feels more natural.  With that said, the Galaxy S22 will again have  two variants of chipsets. One is the Exynos  with AMD graphics and another Snapdragon 898  with their Adreno graphics. Today, we have  the benchmark scores of the latter variant.  The Snapdragon 898 scored 1200 in single-core  and 3900 in multicore in geek bench 5. For  those who don't know, geekbench only measures  CPU performance. For comparison, the current  flagship chipset the Snapdragon 888 scored  3600 in multicore and 1100 in single-core.   Keep in mind that these are scores from a  pre-production unit so the final retail version  will have higher scores. But still don't  expect too big of a jump in scores because  just like Apple, both Qualcomm and Samsung are  focusing on the GPU with their latest chipsets.  So there will be a generation leap in GPU  performance across all the SoCs but only  an incremental upgrade with the CPU. Anyway, the production for the Galaxy  S22's components is already underway and now  we are getting reports that the production  of the handset itself will take place in the  first week of January. So that's when we are  expected to see some hands-on leak of the  handset. Additionally Ross Young confirms  the color options of all the S22 variants. Black,  Green, Pink Gold, and White for the S22 and S22+.  And Black, Dark Red, Green, and White for  the S22 Ultra. It's the first time they are  offering the Ultra in more than 2 colors. Of course, let me know what do you think down  in the comments and as always I'll  see you tomorrow...Peace out "
0HesE4mQ4EI,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"S22 FE This Is Getting WeirdSo the fan edition handsets from Samsung are in a weird spot lately.It started off really great with the massively popular S20 FE back in 2020, but Samsung messedup the S21 FE.For one they launched it too late, just weeks before the S22's launch.Second, it didn't offer anything substantial over the S21 and the price didn't help iteither.The result is a lackluster interest from consumers in the latest fan edition handset.And now with the Galaxy S22 FE, things are getting even weird because we may not seethem launch the handset at all.You heard that right, rumors from South Korea mention that there is no development firmwarefor the S22 FE at all nor any information about its application processor.Usually, we get information about Samsung's unreleased products 8 to 10 months beforethe actual launch.For example, we already know the official code name of the Galaxy S23 Ultra which isalmost 9 months away from getting launched.So the fact that there's no development yet for the S22 FE may indicate that Samsung hascanceled the lineup altogether.The situation is similar to the Galaxy Note 21.I mean a lack of firmware development is how we learned they canceled the Note lineup.But in any case, I would still advise you to take this report with a bit of salt asKorean sources like this have been wrong before.But rest assured, I'll keep you posted.Samsung just announced its financial details for the first quarter of 2022 and the resultsare pretty impressive.The operating profit was 51% more compared to the same period last year.Their semiconductor chip division contributed the most but most importantly, their DeviceExperience division which includes their phone division posted the highest revenue in 9 yearssince 2013.Samsung said the numbers are the result of strong sales of the Galaxy S22 Ultra flagshipwhich is great news for the company and for the Note fans.This basically means the Note form factor is here to stay.Overall Samsung made $61 in revenue in just 3 months.By the way, Samsung also mentioned that new foldables are coming in the second half ofthe year.Now, it will be interesting to see if we're going to see the new rollable phone alongwith the Z Fold 4 and Flip 4.I guess we'll know soon enough.Now we also have Android smartphone sales data for the month of February for 5G modelsfrom Counterpoint research and again Samsung is dominating the list.The company occupied five positions in the list with A52s taking the top spot, closelyfollowed by the S22 Ultra, S21 FE, and A32 in the top 4.The rest positions are filled by the devices from Oppo, Xiaomi, and Honor.Of course, for all the latest updates on smartphone tech be sure to subscribe and as always I'llsee you tomorrow...peace out"

big manufacturers tend touse some song displays and this isbecause the displays are top-notch showthere's nothing to complain here there'sno bone on my display you know thatusually happen with oled displays andall that so the the display can govery low as well can go up to one neatyou know which is very low i think thatis in case you want to like use it in avery you know dark environment and allthat so also it has um this extradim future in case you wanted to go evendemand on how it is so it can go evendeeper than one nit that is but you haveto toggle extra dim feature on so thedisplay has held up very well for me nocomplaintat all when it comes to the display sothe display is very good also there'syou know true tone kind of you knowcolor shifting stuff you know that youknow changes the display as with regardsto what you're doing during the day andstuff like that so best display on anyphone andilove the display on thisvery well so that is for the display soum to talk about the cameras you know wehad to go toyou know to to talk about the cameras itook this phone toon a trip we went to if i started toalexis i want to go see their beach andalso their pooland stuff like that so in that way i'lltest the camera of this phone and so umthe camera of the phone isit has likefour setup you have the ultra wide anglecamera you have the main camera which is108 megapixel you have two telephotocameras that is optical lenses one ofthem is a periscope lens which is 10xopticalcan get you up to 10x optical zoom andup to 100x digital zoom then the secondand the secondtelephoto camera is a 3xyou know lensthat you know can get up to you know 3xfor optical so you can use either one ofthem depends on your situation so forinstance by taking portrait it alwaysuses the 3x you know for portraits butif you want to go longer range and stufflike that you can also always use theperiscope camera so the pictures aresuperb the videos arevery very good so the camera istop-notch on this phone the camera isvery good especially the photo thephotos are very good the portrait modethe edge directions are perfect and allthat so the video if i will like youknow point out anything it's like thevideosin low light they are not you know asyou know sharp as i want it to be buthopefully maybe the next upgrade theywill improve on that the video is goodin low light but not you know the best iwould tell you so butvery good enough but during the day thevideo is very perfect and the picture isof course uh like among the best you canget on any phoneso the camera on this has done did agreat job for me overall since i've beenusing it no complaints on the camera atall comes to performance it's summerhere the phone can get very hot if youput a lot of load on it i notice it getshot like outdoor on it very it was like42 degrees so of course you shouldexpect any phone to go very hot duringfor two years but on your normal daynormal usage just get warm if you youknow push itverymuchyou know so the performance top-notchthere's nothing to complain for meoutside the little bit of heat that iget when i you know push it to theextreme so when it comes to the softwarethe localization genre runs android 12with samsung one ui 4.1 on top so how'sthe software held up for me well thesoftware i think the bestpart for me is like the the one ui islike the features that you know they putin it that is they are useful there arelots of useful features one ui you knowthey have the side the edge panel theedge panel where you have lots of stuffyou can put on each panel and use themwhatever i want to use them there's lotsof features like you know you have adobeatmos you know to help you enhance yoursoundyour music sound there's samsung decksamsung dexes to transfer whatever ihave on this

QGOs4GuMfUQ,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"So earlier this month we got to know that Samsung was using Game Optimizing Service(GOS) in the Galaxy S22 lineup, which throttles games to prevent overheating.Not only that, it seemed to whitelist benchmarking apps like Geekbench from throttling whichresulted in Geekbench banning the S22 and the last four generations of Galaxy S flagshipsas well.Now, it's found that the Galaxy Tab S8 series is also permanently banned from Geekbenchas a result of the same throttling issue.Android Police found that the Tab S8 and the S8 Ultra throttled the performance of Geekbenchwhen the benchmark app was disguised as Genshin Impact.Interestingly the older tabs such as the Tab S7, S5e didn't throttle in this test.Now, Samsung's Vice Chairman and CEO Jong-Hee Han has issued a formal apology over thisissue at the company’s annual shareholders' meeting.He said the company failed to appreciate customer concerns over the issue and bowed in apologysaying Samsung will “listen to customers more closely to prevent such an issue fromhappening again”.He also defended the GOS service saying that the GOS is designed to optimize the phoneand it just restricts the performance of the phone's CPU and GPU to the point where itdoesn't affect the performance of gaming apps but said they have already issued a firmwareupdate which gives users an option to turn it off, promising that such issues won't happenagain.He also refuted claims that GOS is part of the company's excessive cost-cutting measures.Han stated that Samsung does not decrease the quality of their gadgets in order to savemoney.Some users in South Korea were claiming that Samsung didn't use proper hardware that candissipate heat more efficiently to save some costs but the CEO outright refuted those claims.+With that said, the Galaxy S22 was launched with OneUI 4.1 that brought many new featuresto the table including Google Duo live sharing that allows users to share their phone’sscreen with their friends over a Google Duo call., improved object eraser that allowsusers to remove unwanted objects, shadows, and even reflections from an image after itis captured., and easier and smarter file-sharing that can automatically notify you if an image youare sharing with your family or friends has a potential issue, and it will offer you tocrop out unwanted things or adjust the tilt.Also, Quick share can send multiple files, photos, and videos at the same time.Now, Samsung is bringing all of these features to older Galaxy flagships with OneUI 4.1.It will first roll out to the Z Fold 3 and the Flip 3.And then later to the S10, Note 10, S20, Note 20, Z Fold, and Z Flip handsets.Of course, do consider subscribing for all the latest tech news and as always I'll seeyou tomorrow...peace out"
MpkhKrI_0Mc,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,is the s22 ultra really that much betterthan the s21 and the note 20 ultra welltoday we will find out because we aregoing to be comparing everything fromthe designs to performance of the cpuand the graphics we're going to go overthe camera systems the displays cellularspeed and much more i have to say thati'm so glad that samsung went back tothe note 20 design the bodies are almostidentical we have only a few differencesthe sim card slot is now on the bottominstead of the top and on the back thecamera bumps have changed now initiallyi didn't really like it that much basedon images online but in person i lovethe nice clean look of those lensesbeing individual and then comparing tothe s21 ultra i mean who can disagreethat the s22 ultra looks so much betterthan the s21 and of course the s22 ultrahas that slot for the s pen whereas thes21 supports it but it doesn't have itbuilt in and another interesting changeis that the s22 has this little plasticinserts for the 5g antenna which theprevious onesdid not have and i'm excited to test outthe speed in just a little bit andanother interesting difference is thatthe display isn't as curved on the newultra the s22 compared to the previousnote because the frame is a lot thickernow all three ultras have that underdisplay ultrasonic sensor but is the newone better or faster let's go ahead andsee how fast these areokay pretty much instant let's try thescreen offvery very quick and this is the note 20.now one thing samsung has done is justwith software updates they've improvedit from when it came outokay a little bit of delay therevery very quick and all of these areupdatedall the samsung phones let's try the newonevery quick i can't really tell thedifference next let's go ahead and do aspeaker comparisonnow dobby almost is hidden in the menusbut we did add it to all the phones andwe're making sure that it's enabled onall of them just like in yesterday'svideo and when we tested the s22 ultraagainst the iphone we were a little bitunderwhelmed so let's see if it actuallydoes sound worse than the previousultras[Music][Applause][Music][Music]all right guys wow a lot of you guys didnot believe us in our previous video buti think we were right in our uhconclusion you guys have to hear thisfor yourselves atmos is on on boththey're both turned onhere we have which one's the new oneright here we have the s22 ultra let'splay ithopefully you guys can hear that foryourselvesthere's a massive difference in loudnessdude that's wow yeah much quieter thenote 20definitely is quite a bit louder when wewere recording that test it was hittingabout a decibel maybe two decibelslouder on the s21 ultra here's the s22[Music]that's the proof right there both ofthem are turned up all the way atmos isturned on and the s21 ultra soundsbetter and is quite a bit louder this isthe best out of the bunch followedclosely with the note 20 ultra anddefinitely behind is the s2 s22 ultranow no longer a note so they definitelyhad to put in worse speakers into thisphone because they upped the batterycapacity from 4 500 milliamp hours onthe note 20 ultra to 5 000 and now let'scompare the displays samsung made a hugedeal about their 1750 knit display whichis incredible so let's see how much of adifference that makes in the real worldnow in front of me i went into thesettings we have extra brightness turnedon just like in the last comparison tothe iphone and i matched up thebrightness to the top camera above andas you can see the s22 ultra'sbrightness is turned down quite a bitlower than the other two phones and thenote 20 needs the brightness sliderturned up more so to match and now let'ssee just how bright these screens canget if we max them out manuallyright wow the s22 ultra is definitelybrighter it's blowing out that topcamera let me adjust it the previous twoultras are fairly close in brightnesswhen you manually turn them up whereasthe s22 ultra gets much brighter nowsetting the phones to adaptivebrightness and maxing them out you seethat indoors the s22 ultra is definitelyallowing us brighter uh backlighting butthen when we go outside it is reallysurprising to see that even though bothof them are maxed out the note 20 isjust as bright and direct brightsunlight in auto mode as the new s22ultra and then pulling out the s21 ultrawe get the same exact result thebrightness levels and direct sunlightare basically identical now i'm not surewhat is going on maybe samsung updatedthese phones to get brighter than whatthey allowed before but when we comparedthe s22 against the iphone and we sawthat the brightness was very similarwell now it kind of makes sense becausewe're getting nowhere near that peak1750 in its brightness outdoors it looksmore like the 1200 or so that we getfrom the latest iphoneand latest samsung's now of course thatpeak brightness is for hdr video so ihave all of them set to maximumbrightness as you guys could see itwon't even let me control it because theapp is controlling it and let's go aheadand take a look at hdr video to see howthese compare and there it is we'reseeing the same thing as beforethe s22 ultra at the top looks dimmerthan the rest with the note 20 ultrainterestingly looking the brightest allthe settings are the same everything'sset up exactly identicallyand look at that difference in hdr thenote 20 looks the best people in ourprevious video said that maybe theiphone was just too bright in the midsbut taking a look at samsung's otherphones they are playing back hdr verysimilar where you can actually see agood amount of mid detail whereas theirlatest phone really brings down the midsand makes it look like a lot flatter ofan image now the youtube app is updatedand all of these phones they're all onthe latest version and we get thisdifference in playback hopefully samsungcan fix this and update the software tomake this phone look better becausetheoretically it should be brighter andlook better in every way than the whatyear and a half old or so note 20 ultraand just to add we do have theperformance and processing speed set tomaximum so with that said let's get intoperformance to see how much better isthe new snapdragon 8 gen 1 compared tothe previous ones i'm running geekbench5's cpu test here and as we can see thes22 ultra is ahead in our iphonecomparison video some of you guys saidthat the battery was a little bit lowaround 15 or 18 percent that could havehindered performance so today all threeof these are above 80 percent now so wewill get the results again all right wehave a result and this isinteresting because the multi-corescores are almostidentical well you have what's thedifference here between eight pointsover here and a couple hundred herewhich is nothing this is threegenerations of chips we have the 865plus the 888 and the snapdragon onezapper dragon 8 gen 1 but the proof isnot here now single core yes we do havea difference the s22 ultra is 29 fasterthan the note and 23 faster than the s21so we have an improvement there in termsof clock speeds uh but let's go aheadand do one more test we'll do a webbrowsing one we're gonna see just howresponsive these phones are and if thatsingle core performance really will helpday to day and here are the results thes21 and s22 are almost identical onlyfive percent difference in terms of thisweb browser test and the note isactually really far behind i don't knowif that also might have to do with idon't know ssd or maybe something elseso we do have a good difference here butnot a big difference right over here nowthe big thing they hit on as far as thenew processor is actually the graphicsso let's go ahead and test that out ihave 3d marks wildlife extreme opened upright here we are going to test theunlimited one so we're not capped by fpsand let's hope for some biggerdifferences than what we saw in the cputest all right guys finallywe have some good news take a look atthese scores this is an extreme test andthe s22 ultra literally has almostdouble the score compared to the s21 andthe note 20 ultras these are almostidentical so you have 7.3 fps 7.6 andthen14.4 of course is a very extreme testbut this is where we are seeing the realgames it gains in terms of gamingperformance somebody will be doing agaming test video uh so if you guys wantto see that make sure to subscribe butthis is really good news now the nextthing i really am curious about is theperformance of the 5g modem in thisthing we have this new antenna so let'sgo ahead and put in the sim and see whatkind of speeds we get i ran each phoneindividually with the same sim card onthe same settings and here are ourresults now unfortunately the s21 ultraas far as download speed is pretty muchthe same as the note 20 but the uploadwas quite a bit slower than both ofthesenow you see the s21 killed in terms ofdownload speed and did the same as anote on upload now i thought maybe thisis an issue so we actually ran thisthree different times with threedifferent servers and the results wereidentical as you guys can see so verydisappointing i'm not sure what is goingon and then we also went outside and wecompared that performance thankfully itdid get quite a bit better we're in aconcrete room here but we still gotabout the same speed as far as downloadcompared to these and upload wasslightly faster than the note 20 butstill behind the s21very very interesting results i don'tknow if they are trying to save powerthis new chipset for 5g we went throughthe settings to make sure there's no lowpower modes or anything like that we'rein full performance and overall well youguys see the results for yourselves andthese ones we just tested one time andthey worked really wellso that is the 5g for you guys and nowwe have to talk about the cameras ofcourse we have the same design as a note20 for the s22 ultrabut we now have one extra lens a threetimes lens just like the s21 ultra withthat we still have the 10 timestelescopic camera which is awesome andthe 108 megapixellarge high resolutionsensor we also have some differenceswith the selfie cameras so with thesephotos you guys let me know which onelooks better to you and we haveultrawides on all of them now i am goingto be doing a detailed comparison with alot of images from these and it's goingto be blind style like we've done in thepast that is very fun and this gives youguys a chance to see all the imageswithout knowing which phone is which andyou can vote for which one is the bestwithout knowing which one is the latestone so it's fully unbiased so make sureyou guys are subscribed withnotifications enabled so you guys don'tmiss out on that that will be here inthe next day or two so what are mythoughts overall well i'm glad i wentback to this design i'm glad that unlikethe note 20 you could have the fullresolution and you can have the highrefresh rate and the battery got alittle bit larger and we have bettergraphics performance but at the sametime you're spending a lot of money andin the real world we're not seeing thatmuch of an improvement in performanceand we also don't have that micro sdcard slot like the note 20 offers so ifyou already have a note 20 ultra i wouldnot upgrade the speaker sound better onthat one the 5g performs very similarlyyou're not really limited and softwarehas been very well optimized over thelast year and a half same thing with thes21 ultra it's hard to justify upgradingmaybe if you want that a little s penbuilt in that might be worth it but youguys let me know your thoughts with allof these tests down below click above tosubscribe check out one of those greatvideos right over there that's been maxand i will see you in the next video[Music]you
0FwhQPtiROM,Samsung Galaxy S22 ,Samsung,"- These might be the two best phones that Samsung makes.I've got the Z Fold 4 and the S22 Ultra,both are very powerful, have excellent displays,very good camera systemsand a ton of impressive features.But they couldn't offer a more different user experience.So, if I had to choose just one which one would it be?And thank you to Best Buyfor sponsoring a portion of this video.A lot of people end up ordering one of thesewithout ever holding it in their hands.So I have to start outby talking about the ergonomics and the designbecause the difference in this case is quite substantial.The S22 Ultra is a big phone.It's the biggest slab phone that Samsung makes.And we're getting a very sleek design,small bezel, metal sidesthat somehow don't pick up a ton of fingerprints.And this might still be the nicest looking phonethat I've ever used.Now, even though it's a big phone, the curved edgesactually make it pretty comfortable to hold.What's really impressive here is thatwith this super clean design,Samsung was able to integrate the S Penright into a dedicated silo on the bottom left corner.We also have the best camera system in any Samsung phone.The back camera module consists of four cameras,and the system rounds outwith an impressive pinhole camera on the front.The display is an absolutely spectacular6.8 inch Dynamic AMOLED,120 Hertz Infinity-0 Quad HD plus display.It's bright, it's sharp,the colors are vibrant.And in terms of image quality, it's without questionone of the best displays that I've ever used on a phone.When we look at the Z Fold 4,we're getting a completely different approach to design.We're getting a smaller 6.2 inch external displaywhich is slightly widerand has smaller bezels than the Z Fold 3.Then when you're ready to take it up a notchthe Fold 4 opens up to reveala big and beautiful 7.6 inch internal display.This display looks and feels a lot biggerthan the S22 Ultra displaybecause of the more squared dimensions.You can see more on this screen at one timeyou don't have to scroll as much,and it's great for playing games and for multitasking.When you're watching contentit's not necessarily as big a win as you might expect.Yes, it's a bigger imagebut we're also getting much bigger black bars.And if you fill the display with the image,you're cropping quite a bitof the left and the right side of it,again, because of the dimensions.Moving on, and I'll cover this in more detailin the camera section.But there's an under display camera.We've got a pinhole camera on the front.Then we've got an upgraded three camera module on the back.When you're using both phones with one hand,and if you have the Z Fold 4, because it's narrower,it's a little bit more comfortable to hold.But keep in mindthat it's essentially twice as thick.Now, once you open the Fold 4,then you're fully committed to using two hands,and if you have the option,I would definitely recommend going to a storeand handling both options.The Fold 4 also weighs 35 grams more than the S22 Ultra.It's not a deal breaker,but definitely a difference that you'll noticeif you're holding both.The displays on both of these phones support HDR 10 plus,we're getting a resolution of 1812 by 2176 on the Fold,with a peak brightness of 1200 nitsand a pixel density of 373.With the Ultra,we're getting a resolution of 1440 by 3088an incredibly bright displaywith a peak brightness of 1,750 nitsand a higher pixel density of 500 pixel range.If you're prioritizing display quality,then I would go with the S22 Ultra.It looks amazing.And I love the extra brightness when I'm outsideor when I'm in situationswhere I have to deal with reflections.If on the other hand you're looking for the biggest display,then of course, the Fold 4 is the better choice.And speaking of good choices,brings me to today's sponsor Best Buy and their top deals.So whether you're shopping for yourself or a gift,make sure that you first visitthe top deals section of the websitewhere you'll find the best deals that best buy offers.I've been thinking about upgrading one of our TVs.So I was checking out the current dealsfor a big and affordable option.I also found discounts on all the latest Samsung tabletsas well as some amazing open box dealswhich were even more heavily discounted.And if you're looking for a gaming laptopthere are some extremely powerful optionsfrom Alienware, ACERs, MSI, Razer,and several other manufacturers.So you'll be able to find one that fits your budget.There are a ton of product categoriesincluding video games, headphones, cell phones, tabletsmajor, and small appliances fitness, and a lot more.So, if you're in the market for some new gearhome appliances, or a lot of other consumer electronicsbut you don't wanna pay full price,check out Best Buy top deals for some great discounts.And again, thank you to Best Buyfor sponsoring this portion of the video.Another important element to considerwhen you're choosing between these two, is durability.And not to spoil the ending here,but that's a clear win for the S22 Ultra.I'm really impressed with the build quality of both phones.So Samsung incorporatedtheir strongest aluminum armor frame to dateand both phones feature Gorilla Glass Victus Plusat least on the exterior.The interior of the Fold 4doesn't use this more durable glass.Now, the S22 Ultra has an IP68 ratings,so is protected against both water and dust.The Z Fold 4 has an IPX8 rating.So you're all set with water protection.You can get it wet.You can even drop it in water.But you do need to worry about dust.I've had no issues with mine,and I didn't have any issues with the very similar Z Fold 3which I've had since it was released,but the durability win clearly goes to the Ultra.It's a more traditional design.There is no folding display.There are no moving parts, no hinge.So even if you drop it in dirt,or if you work in areas that are very dusty,you're much better protected.And speaking of protection,both phones offer face recognition and a fingerprint sensor.The one on the S22 Ultra is located on the displayand with the Z Fold 4 it's incorporatedinto the power button.Personally, I prefer the S22 Ultra sensorbecause it's in a location that feels more organicto how I pick up the phone.All right, so before I get to the cameras,I wanna talk about the S Pen.Because both phones offer S Pen supportbut the actual user experience is very, very different.First of all, the S22 Ultraactually comes with an S Penand right out of the box, you can bring it with youbecause it's stored right inside the body.With the Z Fold 4,you have to buy the fold edition of the S Penor the more expensive pro model,and you don't have a place to store itunless you buy a dedicated case.At that point, not only are you spending more moneybut you're also making a phone that's already thickerthan other phones, even thicker.As far as actually using the S Pen,the one that comes with the S22 Ultrais small and it's very thin.So it's less comfortable to use,and you're also getting a smaller canvas.On the other hand with the Z Fold 4,you're getting a larger S Pen and a larger displaybut you do have to deal with the crease, which is not ideal.And that's a good segue to talking about the crease.It's essentially identical to the one on the Fold 3,so yes, you could see it if you're looking at an angleand yes, you can feel it.But just like with the Fold 3,it really only bothers me when I use the S Pen.When I'm just using the phone for general use,the crease is right in the middle,so my fingers very rarely touch it.And when I look straight onthe crease is essentially invisible.When we check out the camera systems,the Fold 4 has a 50 megapixel main cameraa 12 megapixel ultra wide,and a 10 megapixel telephoto with three times optical zoom.We're also getting two selfie camerasof four megapixel under display, which is not that great.Then a 10 megapixel one on the outer display.Now, while this is an improvement over the Fold 3the S22 Ultra still has the most advanced camera systemthat Samsung put in any phone.We're getting a 108 megapixel main camera,a 12 megapixel ultra wideand then two 10 megapixel telephoto cameras.One with a three times optical zoomand one with a 10 times optical zoom.Now, finally, we're getting an outstanding40 megapixel front facing camera.If you're also looking for the highest resolution videothe S22 Ultra can shoot 8K at 24 frames per second.Now, personally, that's not a feature that I ever usebut if you want it, you get it.Now, of course, both camera systems are excellent.And the vast majority of users are going to be happywith the images and video that they get from both phones.It comes down to picking the better of two choiceswhich in this case is the S22 Ultra.When we look at CPU performance,things shift back in favor of the Fold 4.The S22 Ultra comes with a very capable Snapdragon,8 Gen 1 chip.The 128 gigabyte modelcomes with eight gigs of RAMand the 256, 512 and one terabyte modelscome with 12 gigs of RAM.The Fold 4 has the updated Snapdragon 8 plus Gen 1 chip,it's offered in 256, 512 and one terabyte models,and every one of them comes with 12 gigabytes of RAM.The newer Snapdragon 8 plus Gen 1 chiphas higher single and multi-core performance.And while it's nice to see the higher scores,I never really ran into situationswhere the Fold 4 felt faster or snappier than the Ultra.Apps opened quickly and run smoothly on both,and the UI seemed quite responsive in both cases.For GPU performance,we also see that the Fold 4 comes out ahead.But again, this didn't translateinto unnoticeable differenceand both phones are extremely capable.Now having said that,if you're looking for the phonewith the more capable chip setthat would be the Z Fold 4.It's also important that we look atbattery life and charging.The S22 Ultra comes with a 5,000 milliampere hour batteryand 45 watts wire chargingversus a 4400 milliampere hour batteryand 25 watt charging on the Fold 4.Now both phones also offer 15 watt wireless chargingand 4.5 watt reverse charging, which is a great feature.All in all, the S22 Ultra clearly outlast Z Fold 4in terms of battery life.It also offers faster charging.So this is an easy win for the Ultra.Now I'm working on a full battery drain testof all the current Samsung phones.So keep an eye out for that.And of course the actual screen and timewill always depend on many factors,including the apps and features that you're usingas well as your screen brightness.When it comes to long-term support,both phones now offer four years of OS updatesand five years of security updates.And it's really nice to see Samsung continueto improve in this area.As far as multitasking, the S22 Ultracan run two apps either side by side,or one on top of the otherdepending on how you're holding it.The Fold 4 can actually tilt three apps at one timeand then even a fourth app in a popup window.While that's nice in theory,even on the larger display of the Z Fold 4,I generally only run two apps side by side.But even when I'm only running two appsthe Fold 4 experience is far superiorto the S22 Ultra because of the larger display.Now, in case you really want to take thingsto the next level,and get more of a desktop like user experiencethen you can use decks with both devices.You can connect them to a keyboard, a mouseand an external display,and then you have a powerful dual display setup.Now let's get to the fun part, gaming.Both chips offer plenty of processing powerto play any of the games that I've tried.That's including Asphalt 9, Genshin Impact and PUBG.And as you would expectless demanding games were not an issue.Now, I have to say that there wasn't really a situationwhere I noticed the additional processing poweror GPU performance on the Fold 4 come into play.But I'll revisit this in my long-term comparison.When with playing PUBG on either phoneyou can set graphics to HDR with frame rates set to extremeor you can set graphics to Ultra HDand then frame rate to Ultra.I pretty much always play on either smoothor balanced for graphic and then extreme for frame rate,so I can get a fluid gaming experienceand still extend the battery life as much as possible.In both cases, I'm super impressedwith the gaming capability.But it's probably no surprisethat I'm giving the edge to the Fold 4 herebecause I mean, just look at this display.Now, when you connect an Xbox controller,and then stream game using the Xbox game pass app,which is something that I do with both,again the fold with its larger display comes out ahead.Now there's a pretty major difference in terms of price.The Ultra starts out at $1,199 for 128 gigabytes.And usually the 256 gig version sells for 1,299.But right now there is a sale.So you can get the 256 gig modelfor the same price as the 128.The Fold 4 starts out at 1,799 for 256 gigabytesand goes all the way up to one terabytewhich is a first for a Samsung folding device.Now neither phone offers a micro SD card slot.So make sure that you getas much internal storage as you need.All right, so having said all that,which one of these would I choose?Just like with the Fold 3 which I already lovethe Four offers a mobile experiencethat's unmatched by any other Samsung phone.And some people would saythat it's unmatched by any phone at all.It's an extremely versatile multitasking devicethat offers a fantastic user experiencefor browsing the web, for social media,for general office type work and for gaming.So if you're in the marketfor a foldable device and you want the latest tech,it's definitely worth the premium price.Now, personally, I thinkthat the S22 Ultra is a better fit for most people.It's still very powerfulhas a better camera system, much better battery life.The S Pen is incorporated into the design,the display looks amazing.It's super bright.And right now it costs $600 less than the Fold 4.Now, you should watch this comparison,click on my face to subscribe.You know what I always say, buy it nice or buy it twice.Good luck and see you soon."
9hvjBi4PKWA,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,[Music]so[Music]hey what's up mkbhd here and i've beenusing pixel 6 and pixel 6 profor about three weeks nowthis is it this is the first year we'reexpecting a realgoogle flagship right so previous pixelshave been pretty nice and they've hadgreat cameras and pretty cool softwarefeatures but overall pretty lacklusterhardware but thisis a step up we're expecting big thingsa big new camera array a new designlanguage they made their own chipthere's a lot going for it so this istheir moon shot right this is theirchance to compete with the big dogs sonow that i've used them i will say theseare my favorite pixels ever and they arethe most google phones ever made forsure but reality checkthey're not perfect and there'sdefinitely some areas where they come upa little bit short so i'm going to goover those things but off the top i justwant to hit you with the prices firstokay so 5.99 for pixel 6 starting and8.99 for the pixel 6 pro those are bothat 128 gigsthat's really competitive so there's alot of action already at that like 599dollar price range but also the one theykeep calling a flagship which is the sixprothis is the one that's here to takeshots at the iphones and samsung galaxys21 ultras of the world and it competesbut the six is the real deal so i'vegrown to really like this camera bardesign for the pixels and the fact is itis polarizing like it doesn't look quitelike any other phone theoretically youknow the huge new camera sensors needall this thickness here but it couldhave looked like any other phone likethe vivo x70 pro plus has the same 50megapixel sensor but they went with acamera rectangle but this visor it's alook this is the uh the pixel phone looknow it's very easily recognizable and ithink that's on purpose and they cankeep it this way for at least a fewyears and the bar design is functional iwill say my index finger does end upresting nicely underneath the camera barwhen i'm holding it which is nice itdoesn't rock on a table either if you'retyping or using it out of your hand theonly weird part is it doesn't quite likeblend nicely into the aluminum sides ofthis phone like i think it would havebeen really cool if it was like aseamlessblend like one piece like what samsungdid with the s21 ultra but there are alot of seams all over this camera modulebut hey at the end of the day if you'rejust going to toss the case on it likethis grip case from channel sponsordbrand it's basically just going tocancel the bump anywaybut now you've got you know a flat evenphone you've got your icons logos butit's still obviously a pixel underneaththat you still have the visor across theback so i think it's a win unless youthink it's incredibly ugly in which casetry not to look at the back of the phonetoo much but come on visors look coolbut the part you look at on the front ofthe phoneis huge on both screens both of thesephones are huge and i think the thequestion naturally is why didn't theymake a smaller one and i think google'sanswer would bewell there are people who want to spendless on a phone but most of those peoplestill want a big screen so they gave itto him so pixel 6's screen is a prettymassive 6.4 inches from corner to corner90 hertz 1080p and flat and with prettysmall bezels overall and a hole punch inthe top middle for the selfie camerait's a pretty good screen again for a600 phonebut how about that flagship though sowith the 6 pro we're looking at 6.7inches 1440pand up to 120 hertz it is super supersharp very responsive and has been anabsolute pleasure but since they'resaying it's the flagshipi can get a little more nitpicky herethese curved edgesthey're kind of going out of style iknow that gets you even smaller bezelsand they are a little bit smaller butthe fact that it gets kind of a bitdarker in the very corners isn't doingthe screen any favors and there also isa little bit of color shift off axisthat you really straight up just don'tsee on the more expensive screens likeon the s21 ultra or the iphone 13 proalso the fingerprint reader on thedisplay of both of these phonesis kind of slow so it appears to be anoptical sensor shining a light on yourfinger instead of those new ultrasonicones samsung is usingand yeah it's gotten kind of annoyingafter a while often it will take a fulllike half second at least long enoughfor me to get annoyed that i'm waitingfor it to read my finger i think theycould have used a better sensor here orat least done this a little faster i amcomparing it to thousand dollar phonesthough so again this is what i wastalking about earlier it's impressivethat it's hanging with the big dogs butit is just undercutting it a little bitnow the top hole punch in the middle ofthese displays houses the selfie camerait's a pretty decent 8 megapixel widecamera on the pixel 6 but it's closer toan ultra wide selfie on the 6 pro whichi really like a lot and it's also bumpedup to 11 megapixels so it can also shoot4k selfie video fits more people on theframe big fan of the six pros selfiecamera and then also you know the littlethings that you'd sort of expect a greatphone to do well but that you don't wantto have to think about too much likeclicky buttonscheck both phones are fully waterresistant and the haptics are reallygood on both phones as well so that's apixel thing but the biggest new piecegoogle's adding to these phones isdefinitely on the inside and that wouldbe the new tensor chipso designed by google for this phonethis is going to let them do in theorythings that they couldn't do with theoff-the-shelf qualcomm chip they'd usedbefore you know machine learning betterai better computational photography allkinds of things they want to focus onwith just this phonethey can do it and it's done that it'sreally impressive now a lot of peopleare wondering how tensor would benchmarkjustand i don't think that's the right wayto think about this new chip but justout of curiosity i threw a geekbench atit and we have the numbers it got 1035on single core 2800 multi-core so that'smaybe 8 to 10slower with the cpu on paper than thesnapdragon triple eight but also stillway way ahead of the snapdragon 765 gthey used on the pixel five last yearbut then also i did uh some gpubenchmarks from 3dmark and it waslooking at 10 to 12 faster than thesnapdragon triple a but that's clearlynot what tensor is about this this mightbe the biggest this is what makes it agoogly phone this is the biggestdifference betweenthe benchmarks and what the phone isactually capable of that i've ever seenso first of all these phones have beenreally quick and responsive noperformance problems for me i've mostlybeen dailying the 6 pro which has gotthe adaptive refresh rate up to 120hertz and i've been loving that but it'snot about the performance as much asit's about the features and thiscontinues a tradition of the pixel phonebeing the smartest smartphone to comeout every year so you know besides thestuff we've already seen like callscreening where google assistants canfilter incoming calls for you or nowplaying which ambiently detects whateversong is playing in the background inyour environment and just keeps arunning list so you can remember whatsong was going on in the background inthe grocery store an hour ago and we'veseen live captioning of any and allvideos and phone calls and movies inreal time besides all of thatthere is some new improved stuff thanksto tensor and dedicated pieces of thatship so first of all speech to textunreal on this phone absolutelyincredible to the point where itactually changes the way i use the phonei try to use voicemore often on this phone because it's sogood so anywhere i'd normally be typingi use that mic button anywhere i can andno matter how fast you talk you canbasically rap at it you can talk 200words per minute like eminem if you wantto and it'll just keep going quick italso adds punctuation really accuratelyso you don't really even have to thinkabout that you're just automaticallygrammatically accurate all the timethis is going to make sitting inlectures and people in class takingnotes way less stressed and basicallyanywhere else transcription is usefuland even on top of all that it's smartso if you say a name it will pull fromthe names in your contacts try to makesure it spells it right if there'smultiple different spellings of namesfor something and you correct it once itwill remember that corrected spelling ofa name things like that if you saydelete this or sendit doesn't type those words it knowswhat you're trying to do and willactually delete the words or send themessage now there's also a new featurein google photos for pixel six that letsyou go back to any picture in yourlibrary and erase the things that youdon't want now this isn't blowing yourmind if you've seen content aware philon photoshop before but i'm mostlyreally impressed with how easy andsimple it makes the process so you gointo any image go to tools and it'scalled magic eraser and it automaticallyselects what it thinks you want toremove usually a background photo bomberof some sort and then you can just do itand if there's other stuff you want toremove you can draw a sloppy outlinearound it it will auto detect the edgesusually really well with any sort ofcontrast finds the object you're talkingabout and just removes it just like thatso it kind of reads like magic andpeople on twitter loved it but just likephotoshop's content aware feelit has certain things it works reallywell on and other things not so much soit works best with simple repeatingbackgrounds you know maybe gradients ortextures and with a lot of contrastbut if you try to get rid of like alarge object that's in front of severaldifferent backgrounds well that's justgonna look bad like that's difficult forai but i was very impressed with some ofthe things that pulled off just messingaround with it it's probably a gimmickfeature still for most people but thisis yet another demo of the powerful aiand tensor that can be pretty greatsometimes now something i thought wouldbe better with tensoris battery lifeand you know maybe i was getting myhopes up too high becausewhat i saw apple do with their siliconhas been amazing like their chips arebasically the pinnacleof efficiency not to compare too muchbut when i see iphone 13 pro max gettingeight plus hours of screen on time easywith a 4300 milliamp hour batterythat's pretty amazing so now i see pixel6 come out40 600 milliamp hour battery in thepixel 6 and 5 000 milliamp hours in the6 proand they design their own chips so i wasthinking this would be amazingit's not so i was consistently gettingthree and a half to four and a halfhours of screen on time on the pixel 6pro and slightly less on the sixwhich is justaverage at best it's not that great likethat's dead by the end of a long daypretty often now on a 600 phone that'snot too crazy you can probably forgivethat but on a flagshipthat's a weakness and then also on topof that you got to remember there is nocharging brick in the box like we sawand it supports up to 30 watts of wiredcharging which is not super fast butit's it's okay and the wireless chargingthat's supported is even a little bitslower than that so the batterysituation for me has been overall kindof a bummer on the flagship i can getaround it by just charging all the timelike in my car at my desk at workbut you never really want to have to dothat you kind of just want to be able touse your phone normally and not thinkabout it but hey using this phone whenit's not running low on battery has beenawesome thanks to android 12. i want touse it all the time totally made overaesthetic material you and all kinds ofvisual overhaul happening here so i madean entire video about all the newfeatures here which i'll link below thatlike button but yeah i really like mostof it at first it definitely feels likea little spread out like there's a lotof extra blank and like white space inthe ui there's these huge ui elementsand really big buttons and especially ona huge phone with a huge screen it feelskind of cartoonish at first but it allcomes together it's sort of this bigflowing bouncy ui with matching colorsand lots of nice scrolling physics andhaptics it all ties together but yeahit's just nice that no matter whatwallpaper i choose for example the quicksettings and the settings app and allthe menu backgrounds and widgets allfind an accent color in the wallpaperand match it right away it's just it'sso sweet it's nice it's nice my onlylittle gripe with android 12is two things actually one that thebrightness slider is two swipes awayit's all the way at the top and you gotto drag it down i i just think thatcould be way more reachable and way moreaccessibleand the other thing is i don't like thenew internet togglei usually just want to turn wi-fi on oroff but now that takes an extra tapand i feel like they could just add awi-fi toggle in the quick settings butjust a general internet one exists butyou know what when you think about pixelwhat do you think of you think of thesoftware and the camera i think thesoftware is pretty great so let's talkabout the most distinctive part of thisphone the camera so pixels have had thesame camera more or less since the pixel2 right this small 12 megapixel sensoron the pixel 2 was pretty revolutionaryfor its timeand so they kept the same one in pixel3. and then kept the same one in pixelfourand then kept the same one in pixel fiveand it was fine because others werecatching up around them with betterhardware but google had figured out areally great way to compensate for thesmall sensor with incredible softwareamazing computational photography greathdr and multi-frame bracketing and allthis stuff that made their images theirnight sight all of those photos lookincredible it was almost like they justproved with these cameras that thesoftware is more important than thehardware itself but now here we are in2021 everyone's catching up and so nowpixel 6 has launched with a brand newcamera system featuring a much betterhardware suite a huge 50 megapixel mainsensor but you can't actually take 50megapixel photos there's no high resmode or anything for it it's alwaysbinning and everything is down to 12 anda half megapixelsand then there's a new 12 megapixelultra wide and the pro phone also gets a4x telephoto camera as well so okay beenshooting with iti thinkgoogle's still running all of theircamera algorithms at 11 like when theydon't need to anymore so this has muchbetter hardware and they had beencompensating like i said for a smallerweaker sensor to bring it up and bringout all the magicand nowrunning that same type of look starts tomake photos look a bit over processed alittle over hdr-y pretty frequently sothere are a bunch of interesting thingsabout this camera but like i said 50megapixels doing 4-1 binning with nooption to keep all 50 means you're onlyreally getting a small amount ofimproved sharpness over the previous butphotos are sharp white balance is prettygood but still bias is a little bit toocool sometimes but you can see inregular lighting the pixel does anenormous amount of hdr and it almostlooks like someone turned up the clarityslider in photoshop just a little bittoo high so shadows never quite get allthe way to black and it's very rare thathighlights like the sky are ever blownout but then yeah that also gives you abit of an exaggerated likeover-processed look when the photoshould just have regular lighting nowthe thing is this sensor is amazing soit's taking in a ton of light and a lotof information so actually the moredifficult high dynamic range shootingsituations are handled great likeshooting directly into the sun orshooting at night with bright lightsthese more difficult shots are actuallyvery impressive looking now because theprocessing is keeping so muchinformation in the final shotbut even so these darker scenes tend tooverexpose when you don't adjust theslider in the viewfinder so it's reallyimpressive believe me having all thissharpness and almost no noise in anighttime shotthat's technicallyincredible but it shouldn't look thisbright so here's a comparison shot withthe iphone 13 pro on full auto just togive you an idea of the differencebetween night modes it's almost turningnight into day on the pixel but here's apretty perfect example to visualize allthis processing on the left is a rawshot from the pixels camera that wecolored with just a quick boost to thevibrance and on the right side is agoogle process jpegand that sensor you can see is getting aton of information and detailand the processingis to make it look like what it thinkswe want on a phone screen again bringingup the shadows bringing down thehighlights sharpening everythingbut i think the ideal might be somewherein between these now the ultrawide ispretty good it's not amazing but it hasa lot of the same traits as last yearand i'm glad they're still in ultra widethere's no macro mode with it though andthen the telephoto on the pro wassurprisingly good when you're movingaround handheld although you still getmuch better sharpness out of like an s21ultra google super resume is pretty goodat sharpening up and improving shotsthat would normally be soft but they canstill tend to look a little bit like awatercolor painting at the extremes butoverall you know as someone who's lovedthe pixel's rich contrast look andreally honestly preferred it for yearsover pretty much anything elsei think this is an almost great camerathat can take some tweaks and and maybesome software updates at least i'mhoping to get better because i i'vetaken some incredible sharp photos withthis camera and i've also taken someweird looking ones so basically i guessthe question is would you rather have acamera that's a 10 out of 10sometimes but also a 7 out of 10 someother timesor just a camera that just gives you 9out of 10 9 9 nine every single timebecause that's the iphone that nine outof ten that consistent shot the iphone13 pro's camera system is moreconsistentbut the pixels camera aces some shotssometimes but then also gives mea really weird over hdr looking shotthat i wouldn't even want to share sobounces back and forth i will say thevideo from the pixel did really level upkind of the same style as the photos ithas great dynamic range greatstabilization and that big sensor isgiving you real background blur andimpressively staying in focus most ofthe time and in some of these harderscenes you can definitely see theprocessing working like here when it'strying to bring up the shadows it'spretty noisy but still overall color andexposure and white balance and thedetails are all great with the pixel 6'svideo and i'm really happy to see thatand then another thing i noticed thepixel really cranks iso all the way upin the viewfinder so you can see a lotof noise before you snap a photo andstart the processing like it's very easyto see this here in a screen recordingbut that's what it's doing you can seein a selfie viewfinder especially it'lllook super jacked up and really noisyjust to keep a high frame rate andshutter speed when you're taking theselfie and then you take it and you seeit process and then everything sharpensup and it looks miles betterand while that seemed kind of weird tome at first i actually think this is agood move so tensor has a horsepower tojust run the stuff at high iso and thepreview might not look great but atleast it's not choppy and laggy and thenit basically under promises and overdelivers people will see the viewfinderand think this will be a bad photo andthen they'll be shocked at how good thefinal photo is when you're taking photoswith faces in them the ultrawide camerais always running at a higher shutterspeed so if you get someone moving tooquick and the primary camera has ablurry face it can merge in the fastersharper face from the ultrawide camerainto your shot automatically i meanthat'syou kind of just never have blurry facesin your photos overall just as someonewho's used now both of these phones fora couple weeksiphone's camera systemis better than the pixelsit just is right now it doesn't it'smore consistent it doesn't struggle withover processing it shoots to moreformats it's a better overall camerasystem butthis the hardware is so good in thepixels and you can see that promise inthose 10 out of 10 shotsthatthe pixel fan in me is like hoping maybein one or two software updatesit'll be a 10 out of 10 more often butuntil then because we don't know ifthat's ever gonna happenyeah you saw the sample shots that'sthat's what it does that's how it lookssoyeah i want to come back to the price atthe end here like i said 5.99 for pixel68.99 for pixel 6 pro it's a 300 deltaand for that difference you're getting120 hertz over 90 1440p over 1080 acurved screen over a flat onesome glossy sides over the matte sides ilike the matte sides better then you getan extra telephoto camera on the backand you get a wider selfie camera on thefront a little more ram a little bitbigger screenthat's kind of it so basically myconclusion ispixel 6really good phone really really greatdeal because for 600 bucks this is oneof the best ones you can getand then the difference in money to getto six proit makes it a better phone than thepixel six sure a lot of good stuff herebut this stuff doesn't vault it over thetop of all the other flagshipsit just you know i would get this phoneif you've really got to have thetelephoto or the ultra wide selfiecamera or the bigger faster screenthat's kind of the main bullets but ithink pixel 6 is almost incredible andthe truth isthis is the most important google phoneyet this this pivot toyou know from enthusiast phones andreally cool cameras and softwarefeatures to still being the smartestsmartphone in the world but also nowhaving much better hardware this newdesign and making their own chip andcompetinglike really competingi'm into it i'm super into it so that'sfun to seethat's pixel six and six proit's techtober so there's still a lotmore to talk about so stay tuned forthat stuff subscribe if you haven'talready thanks for watchingcatch you guys the next

XdXYs_U7xHk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are Google’s latest  phones in the Pixel lineup that I’ve been  using for over 6 months now and these are without  a doubt the best phones Google has ever made,  but what are the top features that make them  stand out, should you go for one now or wait  for the 7 and 7 Pro later this year, is the  Pro really worth the price over the regular 6,  and why would you go with a  Pixel over a Samsung device?I'm going to answer all of those  questions and more. And first,  let's talk about how Google implemented  Android 12 on these Pixels because it makes  these phones feel very different from  any other phone. I've used previously,  Google did a great job making the Pixel 6 and 6  Pro’s software feel very fun and differentiated  from past Android devices. And I love how easy it  is to match the system’s colors to your wallpaper  with the new Material You theming and you can  make it all match your phone’s hardware color.The colors you choose run deep into  the OS, showing up in quick settings,  regular settings and in other UI areas like  widgets and even app icons. Unfortunately,  it seems like only Google’s own widgets and maybe  one or two from apps I have have embraced the new  material U styling, and the same goes for app  icons, you’ll only see the new icon theming  feature really work with Google’s own Android  apps. So, the widget experience, it's still a  little bit inconsistent compared to what you  get on iOS in terms of visual consistency.However, I do like that Android actually gives  widgets more functionality. like for example  the Pocketcast widget, I can just tap play to  resume the podcast I was listening to whereas on  iOS if you tap the same Pocketcast widget but it  takes you into the app and then you can hit play. Now there are of course Pixel-specific features  that you can get on the 6 and 6 Pro that you  cannot get on any other Android device. And these  features help set the Pixel apart from its main  competition from Samsung.Some of these features  are small things like the Now Playing feature that  shows what music is playing in the background,  others are bigger like hold for me, which I’ve  used so much when calling a customer service  number. When you’re waiting for a person to  pick up on the other end, the Pixel will wait on  hold for you and will notify you when a customer  service rep picks up so you don’t have to listen  to that awful hold music for 20+ min and can focus  on other things. You also get call screening  as well with the Pixel where the Assistant  will screen incoming calls from unknown numbers,  allowing you to see the conversation the person  had with the Google Assistant before you decide to  pick up, making a likely spam call very obvious.Next up, also new to the Pixel with this version  of Android is security hub, which I think is  a really well designed upgrade that makes it  easy to check and see if any of your accounts,  passwords, or device settings need your  attention so your security is always protected.Android 12 also includes one of  my personal favorite features,  which is the work profile, which allows  me to separate my work Google Workplace  apps from my personal apps, and it makes it  easy to schedule my work apps to turn off at  a specific time at night, and also has a nice  button that allows you to turn them on and off.Now if I missed out on your favorite Pixel or  Android features, let me know in the comments  what feature keeps you coming back to Android  and/or the Pixel. And to see more content around  Pixel related features and more videos on Google  products, make sure you subscribe to the channel.Next let's talk about performance  and both the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6  Pro include Google's first ever custom design  chip, which is called the Google Tensor chip,  and over the past six months, the performance on  both of these phones has just been blazing fast,  especially when this chip is paired with  the 6 Pro’s 120 hz display. The tensor chip  helps enable some new features this year, like the  Pixel’s improved video and still image processing,  and yes, like in past years, the camera  quality on this year’s pixels is superb  and even the video quality is pretty good,  which has not been the case in past years.The camera experience on the Pixels aside from  the great Pixel launcher experience, that’s been  the feature that keeps me coming back time and  time again. While I’ll admit the differences  between phone cameras seems to have been getting  smaller among the flagship phones from Google,  Apple, and Samsung, the Pixel’s camera still  stands out to me in a few ways. One, the 6 Pro  has the best telephoto lens I’ve used on a phone  thus far and captures some truly excellent shots.The second major benefit of this camera system  is facial color and tone. Google did a lot of  work with their camera’s algorithms this year  with Real Tone to make sure they captured  darker skin complexions much better, which  others have reported seems to be the case  I've actually even noticed that this Pixel camera  system does better than any other phone I've used  previously at capturing my own skin tones,  especially in difficult lighting situations.  Like when you've got hard sunlight hitting your  skin, the color, accuracy, and tone of my skin  tone in these photos is just better than any  other camera system I've used, including the  iPhone 13 Pro’s. Overall, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro  are very comparable to the other main phone I use,  my iPhone 13 Pro and I find I prefer the Pixel’s  look about half the time compared to my iPhone’s.  It still gets you those hallmark, high contrast  and cool Pixel shots which I really dig.New this year on the Pixel is much improved  video processing which makes the videos you  take useable and makes the videos I’ve taken on  previous pixels look pretty much like garbage,  especially if they were in low light  scenarios. Now, the video quality  isn't as good as the iPhones which just produces  way less noisy of an image and overall is just  solid, but the Pixel’s video quality isn't far  behind anymore and something I definitely use.Now one other new camera feature that Google added  this year for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is called  Magic Eraser,which makes it very easy to go into  a photo you take and delete people and objects  out. I’ve used this a good bit compared to some of  the other new features like face unblur and motion  mode which are also new on these pixels. Magic  eraser work pretty well as long as you know it’s  limitations. I use it to take out hairfly, and  other unwanted objects and one piece of advice,  you’re going to get better results if you  use pinch to zoom and then make your edits.And the best part is, you can use this feature  on not only photos you take on your pixel,  but on photos sent to you or in photos that you  previously took in your Google Photos library.Now the next thing I've really enjoyed with  both of these phones is Google beach dictation  feature. It's one of the best new features  on these phones thanks to Google's Tensor  chip. These pixels have a brand new speech  recognition model that will automatically add  the right punctuation and for the first time, it’s  phonetically based, instead of keystroke based,  and in my experience this makes the smart  suggestions much better and more useful.  In fact, Google’s speech recognition model  is so good, I’ve been using it to generate  all of the closed captions for the videos on this  channel for the past month with a few light edits.The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro also feature a completely  new and somewhat polarizing external design,  and after six months for the pro-specifically,  Google just created a great phone to comfortably,  hold in your hand. The metal rails and rounded  edges make it more grippy than you’d expect and  given the phone’s large size, it actually  weighs about 20g less than the Samsung S22  Ultra. The 6 is also comfortable to hold  but I’ve found its brushed aluminum sides  make it slightly more slick and because  it’s about the same weight as the Pro,  but in a smaller form factor,  it feels a bit more weighty.Next let's talk battery life.  Both of these phones have about  average battery life for me. Easily, lasting  me all day with light to moderate phone use.  I use the Pro more than the 6 and  the Pro typically will get down  to around 40% battery after a full day of  use by the time I want to charge it at night.The last hardware feature I've really enjoyed with  these phones are haptics and specifically for the  pro because the haptic engine is actually located  a little bit farther down the phone's body,  you really feel the haptics when you're typing  on the keyboard and they feel great. These are  definitely the best haptics I've ever felt  on a pixel and the regular 6’s are good too.The last thing I've enjoyed with these phones  are the Android ecosystem benefits. You can  download apps outside of the playstore like  fortnite and really tinker and customize  with the device if you want to vs. something  like iOS, which is more locked down. However,  now this leads me to my first downside that I  found with these Pixels and that's their overall  accessory ecosystem. Samsung and Apple are  the two dominant players in smartphones today  and they have a ton of accessories and other  devices you can buy that’ll work seamlessly  with your their phones. Google just doesn’t  have that yet, though recent leaks suggest  they're close to launching a new smartwatch which  we’ll of course review on the channel, So make  sure you're subscribed to see that video, and I do  think that having a smartwatch made by Google will  make the Pixel’s accessory ecosystem a bit more  competitive compared to Samsung and Apple's and  related to accessories, I think Google needs to  make better cases for the pixel. This year’s were  a bit of a disappointment, they’re OK, not great  and make me miss the great fabric cases Google  made for previous Pixels. The fingerprint sensor,  which is a bit slower than other phones I've used,  but has worked fine over the past six months, but  it still makes me miss in face unlock in a Pixel.  FaceID and Face Unlock are the fastest ways to  unlock a phone in my experience and something  I’d like to see Google bring back. Now, the biggest downside I found with  both of these devices over the past  six months has been Auto Brightness.  It just isn't good. It’s not nearly as accurate  as my Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro.  Its too quick to get to a different brightness  level vs. other phones that do a better job  fading in and out brightness so you notice the  adjustments less. And sometimes the adjustments it  makes are just so wrong, especially in low light  situations. I just turn the feature off entirely.The last downside I found with these devices  is only for the Pixel 6 and that's its screen  For $600, I just expect a better screen  at this point. While it is an OLED screen,  the viewing angle shifts which have a green  and purple color to them with this display  just make it look cheap and not great compared to  other phones and devices at this price range. It's  a screen I'd expect to see on a Pixel A-series  line of phone but not for the Pixel 6. Now,  one other thing I do want to mention a lot has  been made about the Google software updates  over the past six months, and introducing new  bugs and issues with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.I have not personally seen that, which is why I  did not put the software updates in my downsides  part of this video. The only nasty bug I ran into  was the wifi bug where no matter what you did,  the phones would not connect to Wifi, but  that was fixed in a later software update.So those are the downsides I found with these  devices. Now let's talk which Pixel I think  you should get, which one to go for, and  if I recommend both of these devices.  And while I do think the screen is subpar on  the Pixel 6 for the $600 price, the $300 price  difference between the Pixel 6 and the 6 Pro, I do  think that is a bit steep. however, if you do want  a much better screen, telephoto camera, a better  selfie camera and more premium build materials,  like I do, then the pro is really your only option  and it's the phone I typically recommend to people  when they ask me which Pixel they should buy.  Based on my experience, I recommend the Pixel  6 Pro because of its better screen quality. Now  because these phones are over 6 Months old now,  naturally the question is should you wait for the  Pixel 7 and 7 Pro to come out in the fall or get  one of these phones now. It's unlikely Google is  going to do a fundamental redesign with the 7 and  7 Pro. Given the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro were such a  huge jump from previous generations of Pixels.My advice would be if you can  find a good deal on the 6 Pro,  I'd go for it. But if you're looking at the  Pixel 6, I'd actually wait at this point. I'd  wait to see what Google does with the Pixel 7  and if they put a better screen in that phone.Now if you don't care about  screen quality of course. Yeah.  You're good to go with the Pixel 6 now.The Google Pixel 6 Pro retails for $899  US dollars and The Pixel 6 retails for  $599 US dollars and you can use the  purchase links here in this video  and in the description below if you’d  like to purchase them or learn more.And if you have any further questions  about either the Pixel 6 or the 6 Pro,  let me know in the comments below and I'll try to  address them there. Hit that thumbs up button if  you like this video, and subscribe to the channel  to see more long-term reviews like this one.And if you're looking for what to watch next,  check out some of our other Google reviews, like  the review I did of the Nest Battery Doorbell,  the Nest Audio, and the Nest Hub second generation  with sleep tracking. So go check those out. For 6  Months Later, I’m Josh Teder, thanks for watching."
MiTG1ride7s,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,all right so i usually keep you allupdated on this but a lot of people askand maybe you don't know so i haveaccess to a lot of different phones andthe question is usually is what phone doyou use on the daily so the phone that ikeep coming back to after i review aphone for the pastyear and a half on android has beensamsung's galaxy s21 ultra soit's a pretty long time for me a lot ofphones have come out since thenincluding the s22 ultra but i keepcoming back to this one you know it'sthe design the display the cameras arerock solid the software is really goodfull of features it's been great now alot of people assumed that it wouldchange to the pixel series when thatcame out in octoberand i really like the phones but as isaid in my review it's not perfectand then slowly ever since it came outit's gotten moreand more buggy now that's always one ofthe challenges of reviewing somethingright people usually own their phone foryears but i have to try to experience asmuch of this as possible in one to twoweeks and then condense it all down intoa 10 or 20 minute video or in the pixelscase 21 minutes and 49 seconds damn butyeah a couple weeks and a couple monthsafter the review periodit slowly started unraveling more andmore bugs started showing up and i'm notreally sure why i can't really tell youexactly why it's happening but i do knownow that the pixels seem to be moresusceptible to it matter of fact thisexact thing this situation we're goingthrough now has happened before when iwas using the pixel 2 xli had the same thing happen the bugs gotworse and worse up until the point wherei stopped using it and switched to ithink it was some oneplus phone that wasperforming well at the time and i made avideo about it so i'm not sure whatmakes the pixel so much more susceptibleto it than other phones but i was hopingthat this time you know having their owntensor design chip and getting thosequick software updates straight fromgoogle would maybe help alleviate thatthis timebut i was wrong so this phone came outin october by january i was tweetingthat my pixel 6 pro has slowly gotten sobuggy since launch that i can no longerrecommend it at 900 which is still howmuch it cost by the way straight fromgoogle so that combined with the botchedjanuary software update had me giving upa little bit and i put my sim card backinto the s21 ultra which by the way gotthat january security update before thepixel did but here we are in april soit's been a couple months and a couplesuccessful software updates later andhey if i'm gonna publicly talk about thedownfall of the pixel then they put outsome software updates to fix it i wannaknow about it i wanna test it so i'vedone that six months after launch nowi've got my sim card back in the pixeland i've been using itand while it's better than it wasit's still not enough to change myopinion on it so my overall thoughts onthis phone are pretty much the same asthe review when it came out like i saidi do actually really like this designwhich has proved to be polarizing somepeople love it some people hate it i'minto it and you can see all the use nowi did get it pretty scratched up i got abig gash a pretty deep one on the topleft corner of my display but that's parfor the course for me i don't use phonecases all the time so yes it stillcollects dust all the way around thosecameras yes it's showing normal wear andtear from the months of being in and outof pockets on tables and tossed aroundall this is normal and the industrialdesign itself is still held up it's verysolid but the question is what were thethings that were specifically goingwrong with the user experience on thisphone that made it such a pain to useluckily i wrote them downsothe big ones for me were number one it's120 hertz display but it was constantlyconstantly slowing down to way belowthat way below 90 often below 60 whichwas annoying this big stutteryanimations all the time opening andclosing appsso that was my number one problemthe camera oh lock screen and autobrightness were also both terrible nomatter how dim of a room i was in itwould never lower the brightness enougheven though auto brightness was onthe fingerprint readeris slowcompared to the others and the camera isslowing down so since then i'm now onthe march security update and theconstant frame drops are 95 fixed andthe camera app is back to normal launchspeed love that that was a huge one forme but the auto brightness is still badand the fingerprint reader is still slowcompared to the others also often wheni'm in a dark room and i turn theflashlight on for some reason it alwaysdecides to raise the brightness of thedisplay way up why i don't know i'mstill in a dark room and i turn theflashlight on so clearly it's a darkroom but maybe there's some sort oflight leakage into the ambient lightsensor or something here i think thatcould be fixed with software but we'llseesome other things that didn't make itinto my tweet though the modem and justoverall cell connectivity is noticeablyworse than other phones which affectsbattery life so i have a i have a deadzone that i drive through on the way towork every day and i can kind of noticewith each different phone i'm testinghow long it takes to regain signal forthe maps app to work again and thistakes longer than any other phone andi've also had issues with wi-fi callingjust that feature specificallyand in this studio with double thickglass and all this acoustic treatmentthe signal in here isn't great alreadyto start with and so i rely on wi-ficalling and that feature has not let memake a call in like two days in a rowhere which is pretty bad and there'sstill a bunch of subtle stuff that's notnecessarily a bug but just affects theoverall feel of the phone like swipingbetween the home screen and google pageshould always be pretty smooth that's abasic animationbut it's not on the pixel awkwardlyenough other android phones like the s21ultra have no problem with this and ialso with this phone have had a weirdbluetooth streamingrandom bug to my car like i'll belistening to music and it'll skip like asecond of audio like a cd haven't had aphone do that in a long time but like isaid the newest updates have reduced alot of the like performance problems andthe stuttering and the animations thatreally made it feel badsoit's better than it wasbut if the acceptable level of bugginessfor a 900 phone was like hereit used to be up hereand now it'shere it's still worse than it should bebutthey have made an improvement but thatbeing said this is still a very strangetrajectoryfor the user experience of a smartphonelike typically you get a phone and forthe first year at least it's peachesnothing's wrong and then as it ages itslowly goes downhill over timebut it feels like the pixelsage concerningly quicklyand google has to try to stay on top ofthat with like a frantic software updateor two very earlyvery odd so at this point i've given thepixel 6 pro another chance and i stilldon't think people should be buying thepixel 6 pro for 900 bucksbut you know it's been six months so nowi'm starting to look forward right so wehave a couple pixel 6arumors popping up here and there that'llprobably come out this summer that'sprobably going to be another phone withthis first gen tensor chip probably aplastic body 1080p display maybe 90hertz that would be nice probably one totwo cameras and that'll be their budgetphone for the middle of the year but i'mvery interested in the next generationof tensor chip and the next pixel maybeit's just because i'm optimistic maybeit's just because i am i trust thatgoogle will finally buckle down thegoogle phone experience and deliversomething goodbut yeah that's this is something we'regoing to have to keep an eye on now isthe waypixels age over time seems toconsistentlybe very different from the way we expectother normal phones to age but heythat's just one more factor to considerwhen reviewing these things for now likei've said my sim card is gonna be againback in the s21 ultra until the nextreview anyway but let me know what yourthoughts are in the comments sectionbelow let's talk about it either waythanks for watchingcatch you guys the next onepeace[Music]
dtZb9BGmEwk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,this way[Music]this is my initial review of the newgoogle pixel 6 pro i know i'm late longstory but hopefully it'll be worth iti've had a couple of android phones inthe last six seven years and morerecently actually changed from my 12 promax to the s21 ultra here but whengoogle announced the pixel 6 pro and thepixel 6 i was really intrigued by iti've always wanted to try a google pixeland see for myself what the fuss is allabout this is not a sponsored review bythe way well it is sponsored by thepeople who support the channel yoursupport is what enables me to go and buythese devices to try out so in a waythis video is brought to youby youand me i always enjoy trying differentproducts anyway as much as i love havingthe convenience of the apple ecosystemthere are certain things that i thinkthis phone is actually better we willcover a few of these things in the videobut i wanted to talk about this onefeature that i think can be a gamechanger for a lot of people like you'veseen in the intro this is just one ofthe things that not only does it dobetter than apple and samsungit completely blew me away is it perfectno but i have a strange accent andwhenever i try to use this featureon the iphone i just end up gettingfrustrated and typing instead one of myviewers i won't mention his name butactually has a condition which makes itreally hard for him to type so he reallyrelies on speech to text and we'retalking about how much this featuresucks on the iphone all the timehe makes some horrible mistakes all thetime and he doesn't even try to fix himonce the sentence is finished with thepixel i don't know what they've done itbut you know where he thinks he heard awordand he kind of knows that it iskind of mispronounced after you finishthe sentence it contextualizes it andfixes it it's absolutely incredible myman rj from rj tech has reviewed thepixel 6 prohas done a few videos on it already gocheck it out laterhe's said that this this feature is oneof his favorite features as well so ijust had to check it out for myself whyam i so excited about this feature wellfor me it's all about time saving i runanother business as well during the daythis channel gets quite busy too soanything that saves time for me is is abonusit can be when i'm driving and trying tosend messages or when i'm out and abouttaking the dog for a walk and an ideapops up i love all of that just talkingto the phone interacting with the phonelike a true assistant is something thathas been lacking form from other phoneshey open notesi can't find any tvs to open apps nearbyi'll rest my case hey bixby oh nevermind i'm not even gonna try that okay soit's got a brilliant speech to textfunctionality is that it now[Music]let's talk about the design i've onlyhad this for a few days now but i wasimmediately in love of howergonomic and you know comfortable it isthe weight is is great and it looksfantastic i love my iphone 13 pro max aswell and i have used the large displayiphone since i don't know iphone 7 orwhatever but i gotta say and apple fansout there i'm sorry i gotta give it togoogle here it is so nice to have thisscreen you know kind of the real stakesbut as well as being comfortable to holdespecially for longer periods you knowin the evening when you sat and justreading and browsing socials the hapticsare awesome it's only a small thing iknow but all of those little touchesadapt to a really great experience whatabout the performance of this new tensorchip from from google when it comes tothat it's not a snapdragon right but itis meant to be optimized by google formachine learning and ailove those buzz words right i only justbarely experienced some of the you knowkind of the speech to text recognitionthat's that's obviously helped by aiand the photo editing which we'll talkabout in a minute but all i can say isyou know it feels reallysnappy sorry about that it does feelreally fast i haven't seen anyperformance issues here what about thecamera do you know that is the one thingthat forever i've been wanting to tryand since i've you know i've knowngoogle pixel all i hear about pixelusers is how great this camera is one ofthe content creators that i lovewatching is mike from teamvri he'salways sharing some incredible shotswith the pixel and i always thought igotta give this phone a go in goodlighting so far this has been incrediblei'm not gonna you know get all oh my godthis is the best camera i've ever usedthat would be irresponsible but havingused the s21 ultra and the iphone 12 formax and the 13 pro max the pixel doeshold its own it's early days for mestill but he has not disappointed at allthere were a couple of situationsespecially when indoors with no naturallightingthose shots are nothing special they'reokay but if you look at this shot herewhich is quite tricky for any camerawithout an nd filter let alone asmartphoneyou know i'm shooting this you knowdirectly at the sunlight coming from thewindow i'm asking for trouble in termsof exposure but it did a fantastic jobyou know i'm taking this shot quiteclose to the keyboard here and you cansee how you know just a point-and-shootsituation it did an awesome job ofblurring the background in what ithought was a very natural way as youcan see here i heard from otheryoutubers that you know photo feels overprocessedcome on guys you know let's be honestand give credit where it's due i lovethe iphone and it takes amazing shotsbut look at this you know when you seethe iphone shot of the same thingit looks awful actually you know andi've tried a couple of different lensesas well with the iphone just to makesure i wasn't like in a macro lens issuelike i said credit where it's due inthis scenario the pixel just did a muchbetter job a lot more on this to come ifyou know the channel you know that iwill be putting this thing throughspaces so if you like this sort of stuffmake sure to subscribe and i'm hereevery week with something something newsomething like this[Music]what about the camera functionality whenit comes to the functionality as wellit's great at you know doing usefulthings like removing stat from picturesi absolutely love the magic eraserfeature magic eraser magic erasermagic eraser it's just really cool rightwhen when i reviewed the s20 on ultrainitially that was the one thing ithought was really differentiating fromthe ios stuff you know with the built-incamera app android just seems to makemore fun to use camera apps of course wecould do a lot of this in photoshopafterwards or any app that you can havelike a third-partyediting app but come on this is in ourhands now and it gets done in seconds idon't want to get ahead of myself hereit's only been a few days but i'mlooking forward to using the pixelfor a bit longer and seeing really howthey compare with the other devices inthe market in terms of battery life iknow it's a hot subject if you paddle inthe pun and i'm not going to sit hereafter a few days and say that it's beenamazing it's way too soon for me and i'mnot using this as my main device here soi can't honestly comment here but firstimpressionsit's not that great right let's behonest i'm aware that some people onyoutube social media have been goingcrazy about how bad the battery isbuti think a lot of it comes down to brandloyalism and people wanting to haveproblems rightwhich is why i want you know i alwaystake some of these things with the pinchof salt and it's always better to seefor myself for yourself too i just needa bit more time to give you a properopinion on that so stay tuned when itcomes to using android and you knowandroid 12 is really impressive you knowi love how much android you know ischanging to make the user experiencemore friendlywhen i jumped from the 12 pro max lastyear to the s20 on ultra after aboutseven years of just using iphones i wasreally pleasantly surprised at howfriendly uh android has been what hasbecome you know these little animationsand the fact that you know the wallpapersort of dictates how the rest of thephone feels there's some really nicetouches now you know the haptics it'sgoing to be tricky to to see this asfitting into an apple ecosystem and ifyou're trying to do that you know that'syou know you're never going to winbut looking at this just as a smartphoneyou know in comparison with othersmartphone experiences this is top notch[Music][Music]all things must passbut i'm not gonna wake upwake up i'mso that's great alex so you're sayingthere's no issueswelleven though it's only been a few daysthere are a couple of things that ithink googlecould have done better some of it ithink can be fixed with software andsome that i'm not sure they can forinstance the optical sensor fingerprintis way too slow for me you know it's notit's not good enough it is a cheaperphone in comparison with the s20 ornotre when it was released anyway butcome onthis worked way better on older samsungdevices like the s6 edge i remember thatit was a really good phone forfingerprint in fact i think i'd ratherthey kept the you know the one on theback where they had i don't know if itwas people five or whatever it was thatyou could just touch in the back colorshift i am aware that some people havecomplained about you know color shiftwhen using the phoneat an angle or something but i haven'tnoticed any color issues on the screen imean who's out there using the phone atan anglejust hold it straight anyway it's hardnot to draw in comparisons with theiphone or the s21 ultra because and soonto be s22 ultra but that's probablybecause it's a similar price range andbecause we're used to considering thesedevices flagship devices my very firstimpression of using this phone was oneofpleasure and lightness and simplicityand that's pretty cool to mesee you in the smiling faces hopefullyon the next one hey google turn off thelightsand i think that's why you've beenbuilding up this wall now and i don'treally know how i'm supposed to break itdowni tried peeking through
iB5fj6Wze2w,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Google Pixel 6 Pro is the most advanced smartphoneGoogle has ever created.To put this thesis to the test, this entire video was captured100% with the Pixel 6 Pro.Smarter, faster and able to keep up with life's daily challenges,the best of Google is truly built around you with the Pixel 6 pro.The phone measures 6.7 inches from corner to cornerwith a bright and vivid screen that's as durable as it is beautiful.On the back of the device are three new pro level cameras.The larger sensor can capture brilliant colors and vivid detailin both 4K video and 50 megapixel photos.The proof is in the footage.Built-Inphotography modes like photosphere make capturing dynamic imagery effortless.Shoot 4K video at up to 60 frames per second and slow motion video up to240 frames per second.So you can see every piece of the action.Google Tensoris the first processor designed by Google.80% faster performance and optimized efficiency ensures all day battery life.Don't miss a shot, text, email or call.Underneath the screen, it has a fastand secure fingerprint sensor for easy unlocking.Pixel 6 Pro is the best to Google and it just keepsgetting better with new features and software dropping quarterly.Capturing this video 100% on the Pixel 6 Pro has confirmed that the best ofGoogle is built around you."
jPm4ouSR_NI,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,all right you've been patiently waitingit's finally herelet's review the pixel 6 and the pixel 6pro the pixel 6 and 6 pro are a big dealfor google they're the company's firstattempt at making a high-end phone inquite a few years and then the firstphones with google's new custom tensorprocessor which powers ai and ml andlots of hopes and dreams i guess it'salso finally updating the camera'shardware after years and years of usingthe same old sensor and pixels thesephones are also justbig i mean just look at these thingsthey're not small phones if you'recoming from pixel 5 or pixel 4 it'sgoing to take some adjustment and maybesome bigger pockets also big that camerabar that's houses these new sensors likebecca said in our hands-on video it'sabsolutely massive but at least thephone doesn't rock on the table when youput it down because the bar spans theback of the whole thing the pixel 6starts at 599 dollars it comes with 128gigs of storage eight gigs of ram andhas a standard wide and ultra widecamera it has a flat 6.4 inch screenwith a 90 hertz refresh rate and an 8megapixel front facing camera nowdepending on how you buy it it willsupport either basic sub 6 5g or thefast but really hard to find millimeterwave 5g if you're getting it unlocked orfrom t-mobile you can expect sub six ifyou're getting it from verizon or at tyou're going to be paying a little bitmore but you'll also get millimeter wavenow the pixel 6 pro starts at 899 italso comes with 128 gigs of storage andit has 12 gigabytes of ram and it adds a4x telephoto camera alongside that wideand ultra wide camera that are on theregular pixel 6. it's got a 6.7 inchscreen with a variable refresh rate ofup to 120 hertz and it has curved sidesnow the front camera on the 6 pro is 11megapixels and has a little bit widerfield of view you might be able to fitan extra friend in a selfie you don'thave to worry about any of the 5gshenanigans with the 6 pro no matter howyou buy it it will support both sub 6and millimeter wave 5gnow the pixel 6 comes in two tone blackgreen or red the pixel 6 pro isavailable in white black or yellowishgold now between them the sixes coloroptions are way more fun but whateveryou're going to want to put a case onthese and that's a good idea becausethey are both big slippery bars of soapnow i've had both models slide off mydesk table sofa arms my lap you name itplus i've nearly dropped them more thanonce we even managed to crack one of ourreview samples even though these havegorilla glass victis on the front youcan still break them easily enough soyou're going to want to get a case andwhen i first got my hands on thesepixels i really wasn't so sure aboutthis design from the front it's hard totell them apart from the samsung note 10or note 20 and from the back they kindof look like tcl phones to me and aftera couple of weeks the design reallyhasn't grown on me sure they feel niceand premium in ways that prior pixelsdidn't but they kind of lack some of thewhimsy and fun that the older modelsall hadlet's get into the meat of this how dothese new pixels perform the answer veryvery good there's very little tocomplain about with either of them bothscreens are punchy and colorful they'rebright enough to read in sunlight andthe faster refresh rates make theinterface smooth when you're scrollingaround especially on the pro if you lookclosely you can find some issues like ifyou look from an extreme angle you mightsee some color shift or if you're usingthe pixel 6 pro there might be somevisible shadow under light screen areaswhere the curves arebut you have to look really closely tofind these things in fact it's reallyeven hard to show you them on video theydon't really interrupt my day-to-day useand frankly i don't have a problem withany of these screens they don't have anyweird bugs or issues like a color castin low brightness or flickering orreally bad color reproduction that wesaw on older pixel phonesnow the tensor chip performed just asgreat as other high-end android phoneswhether i was launching appsmultitasking navigating the ui orwhatever i happen to do it's not goinggonna run benchmarks as fast as apple'slatest chips but it's miles ahead of theprocessor that was in last year's pixel5 and totally competitive with thesnapdragon 8. also great battery lifeboth phones were able to last a full dayof heavy use with plenty left over inthe tank most nights i was plugging themin with 35 to 40 percent battery left ifyou're a light user i could easily seego in two days with this now a lot ofthat has to do with the fact that theseare big batteries and they're big phoneswith big batteries it's a big mood buteither way the problems that pixels hadwith battery life years ago are firmlyin the pastnow on charging both models supportwireless and fast wired charging butneither come with an actual chargingbrick so it's byob or bring your ownbrickthey also do reverse wireless chargingfor things like wireless earbuds theyboth have loud clear stereo speakersand for the first time since theoriginal2016 and in something that matters a lotto me they've got really nice hapticsbad buzzy haptics can just ruin theexperience on a phone for me but googlenailed it here they're soft and clickywith just the right amount of feedbackbut where the pixel 6 and 6 pro reallydrop the ball is with their underscreenfingerprint scannerit's in a comfortable spot it's about athird of the way up from the bottom ofthe screen but it's just slow comparedto others and sometimes it needs a fewscans to recognize my fingerprintthere's also no facial recognition hereso this is the only biometric securityoption you got and frankly it could be alot better as you'd expect the pixel 6pair run google's latest version ofandroid the completely redesignedandroid 12. now for the most part i likeit it's very legible the animations anddesign elements are fun and whimsicaland it mostly stays out of my way wheni'm using the phone it's like google putall the fun in the software this time asopposed to putting it into the hardwaredesign there are a few pixel sixspecific tricks that are worth talkingabout though and the most significantone for me is in the phone app the pixel6 can make life a lot easier for youwhen you're calling automated phone treesystems and it can even wait on hold foryou the phone tree system attempts totranscribe what's being said and itprovides you with easily tappablebuttons so you don't have to sit therelistening intently the entire time arobot is speaking to you but it's stillvery clearly in beta and it misses a lotof the words in the context stillhopefully this gets better over timeanother thing enabled by the pixel 6'stensor processor is faster more accuratedictation which is convenient to use butwill be a lot more useful when googlefigures out how to get it onto a smartwatchthose features plus some photo stuffwe'll get intoi promise i have not forgotten about thecamera are the main benefits of google'scustom tensor processor they're not anai revolution but that's okay becausei'm not ready for the robot overloadsyet lastly google says it will besupporting the pixel 6 and 6 pro forfive years which is a lot longer thanthe typical android phone gets butthat's only referring to securityupdates google's only committing tothree operating system upgrades over thelifetime of the phone which means thatandroid 15 will probably be the lastupgrade that these get come 2024.all right it's time to get into thesecamerasthese new cameras are a big deal becauselike the phones they are big these arejust huge sensors they are also a bigdeal because this is the first timesince 2017 that google has put newhardware inside of a pixel cameraand the main camera in both phones is anew giant 50 megapixel sensor it'shard-coded to produce 12.5 megapixelimages it's set behind an f 1.85aperture lens and it has optical imagestabilizationnext to that is a 12 megapixel ultrawidecamera that's 114 degree field of viewand f 2.2 lens now sadly this does nothave any macro or close-up focusingability like you can get on the iphone13 pro and lots of other phones but itdoes have optical stabilizationand finally on the 6 pro you get a new4x telephoto 48 megapixel camera thatspits out 12 megapixel images it's gotan f 3.5 aperture lens and has opticalstabilization of these cameras by far myfavorite is the telephoto camera it'sthe first telephoto on a phone that i'veactually enjoyed using it's got longerreach than you get on an iphone 13 proand has better compression and subjectseparation so i don't need to useportrait mode nearly as much it's alsoway sharper and more usable every daythan samsung's 10x camera and thanks togoogle's algorithms you can zoomdigitally up to 20x and still have amostly usable picture seriously though iwas on the road to choosing the pixel 6between the two of these but thattelephoto camerait's pretty greatthe new main camera is excellent tooit's classic pixel high contrast moodylooks with lots and lots of detail inboth good and low light it's verycompetitive with the best from apple i'mnot going to declare either one astandout winner some shots look betterfrom the iphone some shots look betterfrom the pixel but both are very goodand as we've been saying for a few yearsnow which one you prefer really comesdown to your own personal tastes but ifthere's one area that i would like tosee improvement from google on it's howlong the pixel takes to capture nightmode shots a lot of times you'll bestanding there holding the phone formultiple seconds at a time to finish thecapture which can be a problem when yoursubject is moving around or you're justnot patient enough to wait for ita lot of times the iphone would takehalf as long to capture the same nightmode scene now the ultrawide camera isgood but it's clearly the weakest of thebunch it's got softer details noticeabledistortion i think it's safe to say theiphone has google b here the iphone hasalso always consistently beat googlewith video capture and this yearyeah that's still the casethe pixel 6's video is a lot better thanolder pixels but it's still wonky withimage stabilization and has some weirdcolor processing that's very differentfrom how google processes still photosnow reds and oranges and any highlysaturated colors in particular look wayoversaturated in the videobut you can easily record 4k 60fps videofor as long as you want without itoverheating which is a big improvementover the pixel 5a from earlier this yeargoogle is making a big deal this yearabout how it's adjusted its imagealgorithms to work better for darkerskin tones and it's great to see thecompany addressing this problem that'slong plagued the photo industry now bothnicole nguyen at wsj and julian chicatuat wired were able to test the camerawith a wider range of skin tones andcame to some really interestingconclusions i encourage you to checktheir articles out we're going to linkthem belowif you look at all the photos it's clearthe pixel is still doing pixel thingsit's high contrast with a dose ofoverexposure to compensate for it andvery sharp detailssome folks might like that look but noteveryone will even if you have darkerskin lastly it wouldn't be a pixelcamera with a couple of neat softwaretricks that make hard things a loteasier than they used to be the first ismagic eraser it lets you movedistracting people or objects from yourphotos that you just don't want thereit's a fun trick but it can be reallyhit or miss this isn't going to put anyskilled photoshop editors out of workyou can also get very similar resultsfrom third-party apps so it's nottotally necessary to buy a pixel forthisbut the thing that really impressed mewas the new motion capture mode whichlets you mimic a panning shot or a longexposure with a single snap of theshutter and no tripods or neutraldensity filters or extra equipmentinvolved at all these are things thattake years of practice and lots ofequipment to capture with a traditionalcamera and the pixel makes it as easy assnapping a selfie i love itwe're going to be doing a lot more withthese cameras too becca is going to becomparing them head to head with theiphone 13 pro in the next episode offull frame so be sure to stay tuned forthatokay so that's a lot ofstuff what's the takeaway here well thetakeaway is that the pixel 6 and thepixel 6 pro are excellent devices andamong the best phones you can buy rightnow in fact i'd say that they're thebest android phones full stop they havea great value the pixel 6 in particularoffers a lot of phone for 600and there's no show stopping bugs orissues to be worried about if you coulddeal with the fact that they are justgiant phones you're probably going to behappy with themnow if you're trying to decide whetheror not that 300 extra for the 6 pro isworth it that's a tough call i reallyprefer the regular 6's flat screen andslightly smaller size but i know i'dmiss the telephoto of the 6 pro if iwent without it at the end of the day itfeels like google really did it thistime it's produced flagship competitivephones without any glaring issues oromissions and it's priced them under thecompetition okay so what are you gettingfast speeds competitive prices anexcellent camera plus that telephoto onthe 6 pro some of the best software youcan get on a phone anywhere and greatbattery lifewhat happens when google tries to makean excellent phone is it ends up makingan excellent phone the app so it's nottotally necessary tomy background fell down there's anothergadget that we've been waiting years fornew macbook pros so be sure to check outour video on those and now you can watchany of our

HAdix0lomA4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"Hey, I'm FacundoHolzmeister, and I'm here to give you an overview of the Google Pixel 6 pro.It's a video sponsored by Google.And if you just bought this device, congratulations.You won't regret it.I can testify because I've been rocking this flagship for almost half a year.It's by far my favorite smartphone release thus far.And here are the reasons why.First off, it's got a beautiful, unique design, making itthe most Google phone yet with a polished aluminum frame, curved glass all around,a giant 6.7 inch 120 hertz, waterfall, front display,water resistance and under display fingerprint sensorand the camera bar on the back to emphasize the triple rear cameras.This phone is pure eye candy.I especially love the camera bar since it makes the pixel 6 prostand out from the sea of other phones out there.And the two tone color theme was a nice touch.The pixel 6 pro comes in three different colors stormy, black, cloudy, whiteand sort of sunny.And no matter which variant you choose, you'll be very pleased.What's also very pleasing is the software with Android 12.Google turned the Android platform into a more playful and expressive experiencethat lets you the user, take charge of how you want your pixel to look.For starters, your entire UI, including the widgets, icon system settings,quick settings, and even some Google maps of all the colors of your wallpaper.It makes the interface a lot more personal and exciting.It's also a neat way to have your phone match your outfit.I also loved the updated look of the entireUI thanks to a new design language that Google created called Material you.almost everything got a refreshed look from the widgetsto the quick settings to even a ton of your GoogleApps makes the interface look a lot more intuitive and mesmerizing.On top of that, this is the most secure pixel yet,and it's made me a bit more relaxed whenever I have to input any sensitivedata or run certain tasks Now here's why.Within the software, there's a security hubthat gives me simple steps to protect my data and a privacy dashboardto let me check which apps are accessing certain permissions.I also get small indicators on the top right of the screen whenever an app usesthe camera or microphone, and I can quickly block the cameraand microphone from being accessed right from the quick settings.On the hardware side, the Pixel 6 pro comes packed with a new processor calledGoogle Tensor and is a lot more resilient in stopping advance attacks.It accomplishes this by having all of my sensitive tasks run on a real corecalled tensor security core, isolating those sensitive controlsfrom everything else, including my applications.Plus, the Pixel six has a security chip called the TitanM2 that protects sensitive data pins and passwords.And for that cherry on top the pixel 6 comes with five yearsof security updates giving me the most up to date protection in the long term.Not, a lot of phones promise this type of reliability.Pixel 6 pro also comes with a ton of exclusive software features,which honestly are one of the main reasons why I keep coming back.You have things like live translate, which automatically translatesmany conversationsthat are in a foreign language within some of my popular messaging apps,and I can even respond quickly in their language without leaving the appfor phone calls.Whenever I need to call customer support.The pixel six lets me see the expected wait times.That way I can call back at a less busy time,and whenever I'm listening to those automated menus,a feature called Direct My Calls lets meturn those menus into options on the screen for me to select.Saves me from need to remember everything.And if you're a big Snapchat user like me, you're going to love the pixelbecause you'll be able to open Snapchat much faster by just doubletapping the back of the phone even when the screen is locked.That's just the tip of the iceberg.I must say.Google now the software once again,not only by making it more helpful, but also by making it a lot more personal.Google also now the performance of the Pixel 6 pro.It's so much faster than its predecessor,and it's all thanks to that Google tensor Chip I talked about earlier.Plus, it also helps that the phone comeswith a bigger 12 gigabytes of RAM and a higher 120 hertz refresh ratethat makes scrolling or animations feel buttery smoothimage processing, gaming sessions, opening apps,voice typing or even just talking to Google assistant feels a lot faster now.It's the fastest and smartest pixel that I've used yet.And the best part is that the Google tensor chip doesn'teven use that much power to accomplish these faster speeds.Saving me a lot of battery on a regular day.The pixel 6 pro could easilylast me the entire day and usually ends me at around 20 to 30%.When it's bedtime, it's all thanks to having the biggest battery capacitythat a pixel has ever seen.A whopping 5000 mah.So no matterif I'm constantly checking social media, responding to several messages,playing games or having Bluetooth enabled throughout the entire dayfor my smartwatch, the pixel six pro handles battery life like a champ.Plus, when the time comes to juice up the phone, the 6 pro providesa great fast charging speed, both wired and wirelessly.Finally, the cameras are by far my favorite feature found within the Pixelsix pro.This time around, the six pro comes packed with a triple rear camera systemthat includes a new telephoto lens and larger sensors for both the main andultra wide to bring in a ton more light to improve nighttime photography.Plus, the front camera is now ultra wide and can shoot 4K videowhen shooting pictures.The rear cameras had no problem capturing any memories that were in front of me,even if it was nighttime.Everything came out looking detailed colors were very accurate.Everything was well exposed in nighttime.Shots still made my jaw drop, especially with astrophotography mode,which allowed me to capture all the beautiful stars in the sky,even some that I cannot see.Quick tip if you put the pics on a tripod and switch to nighttimemode, you'll be able to create a time lapse of the night sky.It's very astonishing what you could do with the pixel's camera.The fun doesn't stop there, though, because the 6 pro's camera also camewith many new exclusives, things like real tone, which providedbetter imaging equity when capturing darker skin tonesand made the scans to my roommates a lot richer.Natural and provided better exposure.Magic Eraser, a feature found within Google Photos, also came in handyfor removing unwanted items or people from shots that I tookI could even magically remove items from pictures that I had taken in the past.It really does work like magicfor times when your kids won't stand still for a photo.The pixel six can still unblur the faces.It's pretty fascinating.And with capturing something with a ton more speed, like a moving vehicleor a beautiful waterfall.There's a new mode called motion mode.Which does a fantastic job adding a creative blur to the subjects.Something only professional photographers could accomplish.Now, anyone could do it simply by tapping the shutter button.In the end, I absolutely love my experience with the Pixel 6 proThere's so much to love about it.From the spectacular cameras to the more exciting and personal softwareexperience to even the unique looking design.With the starting price of $899, the pixel 6 pro is A Grand Slam.it's the complete package, and you're not going to regret the pixel experienceAnyways, that's a quick overview of the Pixel six pro sponsored by Google.If you guys like what you saw, a quick thumbs upwould go a long way to help others learn more about the Pixel 6 pro.And if you want to come back for more,join the pixel team by getting subscribed with the notification bell turned on.Either way, thank you guys for tuning in and we'll catch you in the next one."
kuE8Oz2iyBg,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Google Pixel 6 Pro is Google's flagship phone for 2021.I've been using the Pixel 6 Pro that Google set me for over the past month.So I'm gonna walk you through my impressions of this phone after a month, how it’s camerastacks up against the competition, how it compares to the Pixel 6 I purchased, the downsidesI’ve found so far and my overall recommendation on if you should get the Pixel 6 Pro.First, let's start off with the all-new design of the Pixel 6 Pro.And personally, I'm a huge fan of this design choice, the camera bar on the back makes itinstantly recognizable as a brand and the phone feels premium in your hands with it’spolished metal finishes.Its the most premium feeling device Google has ever made.Another difference when you first pick one up compared to last year’s Pixel 5 or eventhe Pixel 4 XL, it’s much larger with it’s 6.7 inch display.It's basically the same size as the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which I assume is the phone thatGoogle designed the Pixel 6 Pro mainly to compete against.Now after a month, I'm actually quite happy with this size and have adjusted to it prettywell.And the reason for that I think is, while, yes, Google did make a very big phone withthe 6 Pro, they also did a really good job keeping the weight down.At 210 g, its only 17 g heavier than the Pixel 4 XL so you probably won’t notice much differenceif you’re switching over from that phone, it’s 6 g heavier than the iPhone 13 Prowhich has a much smaller screen mind you, and it’s 19 g lighter than the S21 Ultra,making it light enough for me, at least to use were the Ultra...the Ultra is just a reallyheavy phone.Now, if you're upgrading from the Pixel 5, you are going to notice a difference in theweight from that phone to the 6 Pro as the weight difference there is substantial.But again, over the past month, it has been something that I've grown accustomed to.The display on the Pixel 6 Pro is a snappy OLED display that can go up to a 120 hz refreshrate and ramp down to 10hz to save battery.It also comes with Gorilla Glass Victus which improves upon the scratch resistance of thedisplay from previous pixels.Screen brightness maxes out at 500 nits for everyday and 800 nits for HDR content thoughit’s not going to beat the around 1000 nits of brightness of the 13 Pro and S21 Ultracan reach.And on those phones, it's going to be easier to see the display in direct sunlight.Now when looking at the Pro vs. the regular Pixel 6, the other display characteristicthat differentiates the Pro is a curved display, just like the S21 Ultra, and overall I’vebeen happy with it.You can see some shadows on the side of the screen but like the iPhone's notch or a holepunch camera, it's something I've gotten used to ignoring very easily.The only issue I’ve had with this screen so far is accidentally selecting somethingin an app like YouTube while holding the phone, which isn’t something that happens to meon the Pixel 6 with it’s flat screen.Now, there's some limited options right now when it comes to putting a curved glass screenprotector on this phone.You can put a flat glass screen protector on it, it'll work, but its not ideal, butif you go that route, do make sure that the screen protector you get is certified to workwith the in-display fingerprint sensor.Now, the last thing I want to mention about the design of the Pixel 6 Pro are the coloroptions.If I had to do it all over again, I'd go for the Stormy Black version because the 5 millimeterwave antenna cut out at the top of that phone blends in way better than it does on my version,which kind of cheapens the look of it.Next up, let's talk cameras.The Pixel 6 Pro has an all new camera system.A 50 MP wide camera which uses pixel binning technology to create a 12 MP image but alsohas improved low light performance and a great 1.8 aperture.A 12 MP ultra camera with a 2.2 aperture and a 48 MP telephoto camera with a 3.5 aperture.The system also includes a laser autofocus system and spectral and flicker sensor whichyou’ll remember was missing from this year’s Pixel 5a.The front camera on the Pro is 11.1 MP with a wide 94 degree field of view.So what do those specs actually get you in practice?Well, simply put the camera is fantastic.It produces images that give you this great high contrast look and this year especially,can also produce some very vibrant shots.Compared to the Pixel 5 from last year, I think the main things you’ll notice arejust how much better the camera sensors are and the telephoto that is very good.Now how does it compare to the S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro?While in general, it depends on what type of look you like for your photos and the situationyou're shooting in.For example, when taking a photo of a sunset, I’ve found the 13 Pro and S21 Ultra retainthe shape of the sun better and have a more vibrant look, whereas the Pixel looks a bitmore muted.Now in other scenarios like fall colors, I’ve found the Pixel’s photos are more vibrant,and love showing a saturated blue sky and does a very good job picking up the warmthof the leaf colors compared to the iPhone.One thing to note though, the Ultrawide on the Pixel just isn’t as good as the iPhone’sin my experience which also has a wider angle, so images look a bit more dramatic.Now one thing you can do with the Pixel 6 Pro you just can’t with an iPhone is takeshots of the moon with Super Res zoom, which actually look pretty decent, and to be fair,the S21 ultra can do this as well with similar quality and automatic detection.Low light photos overall look pretty good from the Pixel 6 Pro though one thing to beaware of is the Pixel 6 Pro takes a few seconds to capture night sight shots, but once itdoes, I think you’ll be pretty impressed with the quality of shot you get.New this year are face unblur that’ll help eliminate blurry faces and a new motion tabwith action pan that you can use against a moving object to create a motion blur aroundit and long exposure, perfect for things like water falls or traffic to create some cooleffects that look pretty good, if you look up close at some of these pictures of thestream, you can kinda tell they weren’t taken with a DSLR, but for social I thinkthat feature will work quite well.Now turning to the selfie camera, in my experience it’s performed rather well, and is veryconsistent in the choices it makes, with corner cases where it’ll just totally look betterthan iPhone’s selfie camera like this shot at sunset.Google also made a big push this year to fix the Pixel’s camera algorithm to properlyshow correct skin tones for people with darker skin complexions with a feature called realtone,A couple of other outlets have done quite a bit of in-depth testing on this feature.And I've left links in the video description below to their reviews and stories aroundthis feature for you to learn more, so definitely check those out.And next up, let's talk video quality.Overall I’d say the video quality on the Pixel 6 to me has been in the same range asthe S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro, which is something you’ll remember, last that I wouldhave never said with the Pixel 5.Google did a much better job this year on their video quality, and some of that hasto do with the tensor chip’s ability to apply the photo processing techniques theyuse to each frame of a video being captured and the results are pretty impressive.The telephoto camera’s video is actually quite decent, and 4k 60fps looks great inmany situations I’ve tested it in.In general, I think low light performance on the camera has definitely improved fromthe Pixel 5, but you’ll still see more noise in videos compared to the iPhone 13 Pro’scamera, especially in low light, though the Pixel 6 isn’t far behind and in a lot ofsituations, and I’ve found I prefer the Pixel’s color science about half the timein shots like this one, like with photos, it’s better at picking up fall colors.Now, another area Google improved upon with these 6 and 6 Pro’s camera system this yearis a color shifting issue that was very noticeable with the Pixel 5 last year.Here’s a shot I did last year with the Pixel 5 trying to capture fall colors, you’llnotice how the color shifts in an out pretty quickly there.Well Google has finally fixed that issue, here’s a shot of the same area one yearlater, just with slightly different weather conditions.Everything looks as it should..Now as with all camera systems, there are a few quirks with the Pixel 6 Pro’s camerasystem that I want to mention.There’s no 4k 60 with the wide or ultra wide cameras.Theres also a color shift when you switch between the telephoto and ultra wide cameras.Often I’ve found the ultrawide camera has a more blue tint to it where the main sensorand telephoto look a bit warmer.Also, when you switch to the telephoto, it’ll take a second or two for it to switch on andthen the image will become clear.And lastly, unlike with the iPhone, there’s not macro mode with the Pixel 6 Pro, however,I’ve been able to get a similar look with the telephoto lens.You just can't get quite as close to a subject as you can with the iPhone 13 Pro’s camerasystem.Now, before we move on, let me tell you a bit about this video’s sponsor: Audible.I've been an Audible customer for almost a year.Now, I originally signed up because I was one of those people who started books, butcould never finish them.But at the same time, I love podcasts.I listen to them all the time and what is an audiobook if not a long-form podcast.So I gave Audible a try and fell in love with the service.And there are so many things to listen to on Audible.The audiobook I’m currently listening to is the Cult of We, an inside look at the foundingof WeWork and how it’s mioritic rise came crashing down, and I highly recommend it.And one other thing that I also really like about the audiobooks that you can find onAudible is oftentimes, they're actually read by the author and listening to them tell theirown story often feels even more authentic and compelling to me than just reading theirwords on a page.Now, how does Audible work?The way Audible service works is you sign up for a monthly membership where you getone credit every month that you can use to buy any title on the service, and each creditis good for up to one year, so you don't have to worry about spending it right away.Once you purchase a title with a credit, it’s yours to keep forever forever in your library.Being an Audible member also gets you access to the Plus Catalog, which is filled withthousands of audiobooks, fitness and meditation guides, and podcasts, with no credits needed.Try an audible membership today and get your first 30 days absolutely free by visitingaudible.com/sixmonthslater or by texting 6monthslater to 500-500.And for a limited time, save 60% on your first three months of audible, That's only $5.95a month!Now, last feature related to cameras that I want to mention with the Pixel 6 and 6 Prothat's a really cool is Magic Eraser.It allows you to go into a photo and remove objectsor people from the background, like this trashcan.Now I find it works best when you’re trying to take an object out of a more uniform background.I’ve also found it works very fell for blemishes or acne on your face.And the coolest part is not only does it work on photos you took with the Pixel 6 Pro, butother photos from your Google Photos library as well.All right.Next up, let's talk about Tensor, the custom-made processor that Google put in this phone.Overall, the performance of the phone has been stellar and on par with what I experiencewith my Galaxy S21 Ultra, haven’t run into any lag or performance slowdowns at all andgaming like on Fortnite, which you can download on a Pixel, works great.But Tensor isn't just there for performance.It's also there to enable features like the Magic Eraser and the new video processingand the new updated speech dictation that uses Google's natural language processingdirectly on the device.It's super fast and has phonetically based suggestions and decisions that it makes.And It remembered how to spell my last name correctly, which is a first on a pixel device.Typically it spells my last name wrong and the cool thing is it can also remember howyou spell your friend's names correctly as well.Its easy to make quick adjustments by tapping a word and saying what you want to say insteadand I love that you can give it commands like send, clear, or new paragraph.And that's just one of the many parts of Android 12 that I've come to enjoy on my 6 Pro.Another new part of the Pixel experience this year is called Material You.It makes the phone’s hardware and software feel much more closely aligned by being ableto auto pick a color scheme that matches the background image on my phone which in turnmatches the sorta sunny color of my Pixel 6 Pro.It feels fresh and I think this is the first time I've ever said this, but Android todayjust feels more visually consistent and just way more interesting than iOS.I also love the at a glance feature on the home and lock screens that show you upcomingcalendar events or flights, and best of all, if you have a work profile on your Androiddevice, at a glance will integrate with your work calendar as well as your personal one.I love that you can even turn on themed icons in the phone’s settings to automaticallytransform icons you place on the home screen to match your Material You theme.Now they work for most of Google’s apps but not every app will work with this featurewhen added to your home screen.And speaking of home screens, Google actually updated several of their widgets to matchthe new material you theme, though widgets from third parties could still use some loveand be updated to match the material you theming.The typing experience for me on the Pixel 6 Pro has been the best typing experienceGoogle has ever made for a pixel phone and for me at least it's been the best typingexperience I've had on any phone period.Thanks to the fantastic haptics that Google put into the six Pro, which feels much morepronounced than on previous pixels and among the best haptics I've experienced on a phone.Some of this is likely due to the fact that Google put their haptic engine towards thebottom of the 6 Pro because they didn't do that on the 6 and the haptics aren't as pronouncedon that phone with its typing experience.There's also a new way to trigger the Google Assistant this year with the 6 and 6 Pro bydefault.You now do this by long pressing the power button which to me has been a much betterfeature than the hot corners that we had with the Pixel 5, which still can be enabled thoughon the 6 Pro if you like that feature.Another feature I’ve found very useful on this phone is auto rotate with face detection.Google uses the front facing camera to detect the orientation of your face so it won’trotate the phone to landscape while you’re lying down reading on your phone which sofar for me, has worked pretty well.As in years past, The Pixel 6 Pro features call screen and Hold for Me but new this yearis a new feature that’ll tell you the best times to call a customer service number soyou won’t wait on hold for so long.Live translate was also updated this year and expands to not just caption videos inother languages but also help translate messages in chat apps and all the translation runsmuch better thanks to the Tensor chip and new language processing models that run onthe Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.There’s also a new quick tap features where you can double tap the back of your phoneto launch an app, view recent apps and if you miss the back fingerprint sensor for bringingdown the notification shade, you can set-up quick tap to do exactly that.So how's the battery life on the phone?For me it's been pretty good.I’m seeing my phone last me almost two days on a fullcharge, now I’m not shooting 4k 60 for a few hours every day, so your mileage may vary,but overall, based on my experience, I think this phone will easily last most people allday and should last even heavy users all day.Now, if you're coming from a pixel 5, to the 6 Pro or 6, you'll appreciate the Google hasditched the approach they took to last year's Pixel 5 with this speaker system.and the speaker on the Pixel 6 Pro sounds much improved.Also, the flashlight has been improved as well, it’s more of a true white and verynice.Now the last thing I want to talk about with this phone is the fingerprint sensor.A lot has been made about it and in my experience at least, it is slower than the Pixel 5’sfingerprint reader and the S21 Ultra’s ultrasonic reader, and sometimes, it won’t get a goodread and you’ll have to retry or press down harder.It's something you do get used to when using this phone for over a month, but when youcompare it to the competition, it's definitely been the largest downside for me to usinga Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.And it makes me wish that Google had figured out a way to put face unlock back into a pixel.All right.So that's everything I like about the Pixel 6 Pro's experience and some of the downsidesI’ve found with it as well.You get a lot of cutting edge features with this phone but also a phone that does thebasics very well.And one of the best parts of this entire experience is the price of this device.It starts at $899 with 128 GB of storage, which represents a great value and undercutsthe competition from Samsung.The Pixel 6 Pro is a phone made by Google that’s firing on all cylinders.It gives you enough new and unique experiences with it’s camera system and custom Tensorchip but also does well with battery life in my experience and has a more modern formfactor, which wasn’t the case with the Pixel 4 XL, the last premium phone Google put outon the market.I fully recommend the Pixel 6 Pro to people who want that pixel experience and all thefeatures and functionality that come with that experience.Plus, they want to in a phone with a better screen, premium materials and one that hasa telephoto lens.Now, if you don't need all of those add-ons or think it’s worth the price differencecompared to the Pixel 6 at $599, then the 6 is still an excellent choice and we’llbe doing our one month later review on that phone soon so make sure you’re subscribedto see that.If you already have a Pixel 5 or older, I do recommend upgrading to this year’s generation,it's a huge leap forward in the PixelIf you have any questions about the Pixel 6 Pro,

roWxo6jWoYw,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,
fIjOpJMm-R4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"- This video is sponsored by Amazon Education.The Pixel 6 Pro is, in my opinion,Google's most premium phonethat it's ever releasedfrom a hardware perspective.It's a phone that has given the Pixel line,what I hope will be,a true visual identity going forward.I know the Pixel 6 Prohas been going through some issues,and that Google has been trying to drop software updatesto fix these things,but it's been a few months.So, let's talk about the Pixel 6 Pro.(dynamic music)First, touching on the hardware.As I mentioned a minute ago,this is Google's most premium smartphoneand it's very apparentwhen holding it in your hand.It's substantial.I like what Google's donewith this new IP68 certified design,and the addition of Corning Gorilla Glass Victuson the front and backwith that shiny aluminum frame.The two-tone color scheme is interesting,and this Sorta Sunny one herethat Google sent over for reviewis definitely my favorite,but you can also get itin Stormy Black and Cloudy White.Now, one note though,to me, the phone is definitely large.If you're used to smaller and sleeker phones,adapting might be a challenge with the Pixel 6 Pro,especially if one-handed use is important to you.But that said, it's not as easyas just choosing the standard Pixel 6 insteadsince there are enough differencesbetween the two devicesbesides just the size.Now, while I'm not a case guy at all personally,and prefer using my phones naked,I also acknowledge that over 90% of people slap a caseon their smartphone,and I think that's a very good decisionhere on the Pixel 6 Pro.First, that curved edge displayis something that I've never been a fan of,due mostly to phantom touches.The display will pick up your palm,touching those edges as input,which can be frustrating to say the least.Secondly, if the protruding camera bar bothers you,a case will make that more flush.All right, next, we've got to talk about this display.What we have here is a 6.71-inch,LTPO AMOLED panelthat provides plenty of spacefor whatever you want to do,whether it's watching a videoor multitasking.It also sports thingslike 120-hertz Dynamic Refresh Rate,HDR for those colors and deep blacks,with a 1440 by 3120 resolution,giving you 512 pixels per inchand a 19.5 by 9 aspect ratio.If I had a complaint about the display,it's that they don't seemto be as high qualityas what you get on the latest iPhoneor Samsung devices.There's color shifting,went off angle,and shadowing under the curved edgesthat's apparent when viewing lighter colors.Now, this doesn't mean these displays are bad, mind you,just that they aren't the best out there.As far as biometric authentication goes,the Pixel 6 Pro does fingerprints and fingerprints only.That's not necessarily a bad thing,but I know a lot of people will compare thisto something like a Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus or Ultra,where you have multiple methods,fingerprint and face scan, for example.The disappointing part on the Pixel'sis that the in-display fingerprint sensor is slower.In fact, it's slower than the rear fingerprint sensoron previous Pixel devices.It's also optical instead of ultrasonic,so, the screen needs to light up when you authenticate,which is not the best when in a dark room.If fingerprint unlock is going to be the one methodof authentication offered,you need to make sure it's really good.But on the Pixel 6 Pro,it's just okay.Then there's Google's Tensor chip.Tensor is the chip that powers the Pixel 6 lineup,rather than something like the Qualcomm Snapdragon series.It's Google's first custom processor,which is similar in veinto what Apple does with its A series chips.Google says the chip rivals the Snapdragon 888 in power,and that certainly seems to be the case.Tensor leans heavily on AI,which helps with tasks like translating languages,optimizing battery usage, gaming,speech recognition,and several camera features.Alongside the Tensor chip,the Pixel 6 Pro sports 12 gigabytes of RAMand up to 512 gigabytes of storage.And if you wanna be impressed,open up Dictation and just start talking.It's scary how good the Pixel 6 Pro isat capturing what you're saying perfectly.When it comes to battery,I had zero complaints.You can easily get through a full day of usagewithout having to worry.Often, I'd finish the daywith about 30% battery life remaining,even while using the Always On displayand taking the phone out for a day of photo shooting.If you're a light user,I wouldn't doubtthat you could get two full daysout of the Pixel 6 Pro.23-watt wireless chargingand 30-watt fast wire-chargingare supported here too.And fast-wire charging will take youfrom zero to 50% top-up in 30 minutes.But there's no charging adapter included in the box,so, shop accordingly.Now, before we talk about my biggest disappointmentwith the Pixel 6 Pro,I want to give a big shout outto the sponsor of this video,Amazon Education.Did you know that Amazon offers an

let's move on to my biggest disappointment.For me, the problem that I just can't look pastis the buggy software experience.Now, I know even hearing me say that sentenceabout a Pixel device might feel strangebecause nailing the softwareis kind of what the Pixel has been known for,that and the amazing camera.Now, this device is running the latest version of Android,Android 12.But it seems that with every update,the phone gets buggier instead of better.Now, granted, Google is fixing things with these updates,but it just feels like the Pixel 6 Prois a product that's in betarather than a finished one.Even with security patches,which you think would be pushedto Pixel devices right away,the Pixel 6 Pro is starting to get them laterthan Samsung's smartphones.And to me, that's just strange.That said, this is still a flagship level device,if not right in the same territory.It'll be a fine phone for most people out therelooking for a great piece of Android hardware.It's just that when you come across several bugsin the software,you're gonna be annoyed.And the Pixel 6 Pro still hasn't fixed all thateven a few months after launch.Now, something you can't take awayfrom the Pixel series thoughis the camera.And this year, the sensors and lensesare all new for the first time since 2017.The main sensor is way largerthan the one used in the Pixel 5 and earlier.And the Pixel 6 Pro is the first in the lineupto have a trio of wide, ultra wide, and telephoto cameras.Now, the main camera is a 50-megapixel sensorthat is hard-codedto generate 12 and a half megapixel pictureswith an optically stabilized f/1.85 lens.That means you won't be ableto capture the whole 50-megapixel resolution,and the photos will not be any sharper or more detailedthan other 12-megapixel images.Still, the images are very good in both normaland low light,and very competitive with the best from Apple,with the classic Pixel look,that's high contrast,slight over exposure,extreme sharpness,and cooler white balance.I won't say there's a clear winner here.Some images from the Pixel 6 Pro look better.Some images from the iPhone 13 Pro look better.And which you prefer really comes downto your own personal preferences,which I've been saying about smartphone camerasfor several years now.Google's artificial portrait modeis also largely unchanged.It aggressively blurs the backgroundto the point where sometimes it almost lookslike the subject is a cardboard cutoutplaced into the scene.Some people love this,but I'm more a fan of the Apple and Samsung approachto portrait mode than Google's.One area I'd like Google to improve ishow long its amazing night mode takesto actually capture a shot.It's incredible how much detail the night modeis able to capture,and I'm talking about in super dark scenes.But it takes a few to several seconds to do so.And a lot of the time,either the subject or the person taking the photoloses patience and things get blurry.The iPhone 13 Pro lineup's night modetakes about half as long to capture night scenesas the Pixel.Ultimately, while the hardware has been upgraded,the images themselves are hard to differentiatefrom a Pixel 5 or earlier.This just goes to show that the Pixel imagesrely heavily on AI processing,and that's totally fine.Google has mastered that artand it makes for great images.While the ultra wide camera is kind of forgettable,the telephoto is really goodand produces sharp, detailed images.I'm glad to see it was included here.Google has also made a big deal about tweaks it madeto its image processing algorithm this yearto better handle darker skin toneswhich it's calling Real Tone.You may have seen thisin the Super Bowl commercialthat Google dropped this year.This is a problem that's beenin the photo industry for many decadesthat's been ignored,and it's cool to see Google tackling it.The Pixel 6 Pro has a lot going for it,and it could have been one of the better smartphonesfor the year,since it launched late in 2021.But the buggy software experiencehas certainly been a letdown.Now, if you're interested in the Pixel lineupdue to the features I mentioned here,the standard Pixel 6has a lot of the same features as the Prominus the telephoto camera,and it has a flat display with a lower resolutionand lower refresh rate.I personally think it works better when using it,and you can get this one for hundreds less than the Pro,making it the overall better deal in my opinion.Thanks for watching us always, guys,I appreciate your support.I am Andru Edwardsand I will catch you in the next video."
NE5H5intsck,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,foreign[Music]pixel sevens seven and seven per I'musing these songs for about a week nowand yes they are very similar to lastyear they're the same prices too butmore than ever this year and you can seeit at every corner the pixel special issoftware solutions to Hardware problemsand this is in contrast to say theSamsung or the xiaomi special which isthrow as much raw Hardware horsepower atthe thing as possible there's just noway that isn't better than before andthere's nothing right or wrong witheither of these approaches matter offact as a Tech head you can kind ofappreciate both but there is there isjust a little bit of a magic to thissoftware way at least when it works soyeah I can definitely appreciate theslightly updated Hardware on the outsideof the pixel because even though itisn't super important to the GoogleMission it's still important to theusers so initially with my very firstHands-On I didn't love it but it's kindof growing on me the main change herebeing the metal camera bar instead ofthe All Glass visor from last year itlets them do some interesting stuff withthe colors but most importantly letsthem make it all one piece of metal allthe way around with the frame of therest of the phone it's polished aluminumon the pro and matte aluminum on thepixel 7. then both phones also getbrighter displays up to 1500 nits Peakon the 7 Pro and 1400 nits on theregular pixel 7. can't fake that withsoftware and then the 7 Pro display islarger slightly curved over the edgesand a generally better looking displaywith less off-axis rainbowing butinterestingly it's set to 1080p out thebox by default even though it's a 1440ppanel I immediately switched that to1440 and have had no battery issues so Irecommend doing that matter of factmight as well just say it right off thetop I have had great battery experienceswith these phones I've been mostlydailying the 7 Pro David at the studiohas been dailying the seven and yeahthey've been excellent like just thismorning today drove into the studio hadan hour-long commute with Waze on fullbrightness GPS streaming Spotify audiothrough Bluetooth to the car got herewith like 85 battery left and I'mconsistently ending days with 30 to 40percent six to seven hours is not aproblem uh yeah I've had very goodbattery life on these phones veryimpressive that's a combination ofsoftware optimization better modems justbetter chip overallbut speaking of chips inside the phonethere are very few new specs but the newsecond generation tensor G2 from Googleis one of them there's also a little bitextra RAM on the pro phone it doesBenchmark a bit higher than the firsttensor but in terms of raw power it'sright in line with the Snapdragon 865fine but just like I talked about in theproblem with benchmarks video which youcan watch here if you haven't seen italready Google is optimizing this tensorG2 chip to work more efficientlyspecifically with its AI stuff it's AImagic so while yeah the G2 is a littlefaster than the first tensor with itssmaller four nanometer process node thereal improvements are in its machinelearning capabilities which are 60faster and 20 percent more efficientthan last year so the things thatactually require those AI smarts aredramatically better and faster so thatis where it starts to get interestingnot to dismiss the you know slightimprovements of the pixel overall I meanyou can see they even they paintedinside the port and the speakers downhere to match the rails of the phoneit's nice I like it but that's not whatthe pixel is all about the pixel is thesoftware it is the smartest smartphoneand pretty much all the reasons you'dpick a phone like a pixel 7 over therest are in the software like for phonecalls for example pixel is the onlyphone with call screening which to me isstill super useful but it also goes toanother level so when you call abusiness that has an automated systemthe improved direct my call feature willsurface all the buttons at once so youcan press to navigate through anautomated system before the robot evenfinishes saying them it saves me so muchtime I love that I also like the newhome screen search which still has allthe great functionality as before it'sjust cleaner and better designed andthen with the new selfie camera thepixel has added AI based Face Unlockwhich is great but as you can see it'sjust a single selfie camera up top herethere's no infrared depth mapping orface ID equivalent so while it's superfast in great conditions it absolutelystruggles as expected when you're in thedark or when you have a mask on sothere's also still an under displayfingerprint reader for dual biometricauthentication anytime Face Unlock failsI will say I was hoping that thefingerprint reader would be one of thethings that improved to the pixel 7Hardware wise because the one in the sixwas a little bit of a letdown for meit's it's not noticeably bigger orfaster it's fine it's notterrible it's just a slight step behindthe ultrasonic ones which are noticeablyfaster than this Optical one oh also therecorder app most some people don't evencare about this but the recorder app isbetter it's already the best in theworld at doing incredibly fast andaccurate speech to text you've seen thisbefore thanks tensor but I got anamazing demo of somebody starting arecording and then putting the phone intheir pocket and we had a full-onconversation they took the phone out oftheir pocket and it had perfectlytranscribed our entire conversation withspeaker labels so each time the oppositeperson spoke it labeled thatincredibly useful or incredibly creepydepending on who you are but that's oneof the features that's allegedly cominglater this year to an update I'm goingto be using that and it just definitelyfeels like anywhere you go on this phoneGoogle assistant is waiting right aroundthe corner waiting to help you out itwas the same with the last pixel Android13 got its improvements with material Uand the under the hood improvements butjust the Google stuff everywhere theroutines the little reminders the littlechip cards words and messages forhelpful things you might want to do toadd to a message there's a lot of goodstuff there's even a new feature calledphoto unblur you might have seen thedemos basically takes any photo in yourpixel 7's Library actually anything inyour Google photos library at all and ifit's a little bit blurry you hit thatunblur button and it can use AI toidentify what the scene should look likeand fix the photo remove the blur seemssuper cool so okay after trying thiswith a bunch of photos we found that itseems to work best specifically withphotos of subjects that are in Focus butthe exposure time was too long and sonow there's a bit of blur in OneDirection in that exact instance I foundit can do a pretty good job of turning astreaky blurry photo into something muchmore usable I wouldn't expect anythingmagical but you know this is pretty coolit's the definition of using software tosolve Hardware problems also if they dosay pixel 7 exclusive for this featurefor nowI don't really buy it they say it'sbecause of temps or G2 I give it about ayear before this feature is availablefor more phones maybe anyone usingGoogle photos but hey for now gotta havea pixel 7. but the point is Google isnot setting out to make a phone with theabsolute best hardware and the bestdisplay and the absolute best rawperformance I mean if they are they'refailing but Google pixel is absolutelythe smartest smartphone in the room it'sthe smartest phone you can get and it'seven more true again this year now thepixel has been known for one other thingprobably as long as anything else andthat's the cameras and there's anupdated Suite of cameras on the frontand the back of the pixel 7s this yearso the 50 megapixel primary camera isthe same on both same as last year thepro gets a new even wider Ultra widewith autofocus while the 7 keeps the onefrom last year and the pro also gets anew 5x 48 megapixel telephoto camera andas expected the pixel 7 and 7 Pro take Xexcellent photos in a variety ofdifferent lighting conditions and theyhave that very distinct pixel style thehigh dynamic range contrasty lots ofdetail those shots this big sensor cancreate some pretty nice natural depth offield still without using portrait modeI love that I know I shouldn't be superimpressed that you know normal daylightphotos look great on the pixel but heythese are really really good and thenthe new Pro Ultra wide does a reallygood job with macro photography doesn'tdo macro video but this photo of an antis really hard to get and the autoswitching to macro mode can be disabledif you're like me and prefer takingclose-up photos of things with the maincamera just be aware of minimum Focusdistance but then here's another greatexample of solving Hardware problemswith software the zoom so the One Xcamera still normal 1X that's a 50megapixel main sensor binning down to 12megapixels the 2x button is a 12megapixel crop of the middle of theframe so a high quality Zoom then from2x to 5 5x the camera is actually doingsome composition it's adding detail inthe middle of the frame from thetelephoto camera and then compositingthem together then you get to 5x andit's snapping to the full telephotocamera that makes perfect sense thenagain the 10x is taking a 12 megapixelcrop of the middle of the telephoto soanother high quality zoom and it'spretty good I will say it's not quite asgood as having a dedicated 10x telephotocamera on the back of the phone likehaving a dedicated camera is alwaysgoing to give you the sharper overallimage but for someone like me who onlyzooms once in a while the whole superresume software solution is verypassable as you can see and then thatsaves you money and then you get thezoom stabilization that activates at 15xand it is really really stable maybe alittle too stable sometimes because itkind of makes it hard to track likemoving objects which I know you love todo when you're creeping I mean birdwatching anyway yeah the pixels cameraright still top of the Heap when itcomes to point and shoot Android camerasthe shutter speed is super fast so ifyou're trying to freeze motion and alsocapture like an exact moment this camerais really good at that the selfiecameras on both are also improved it'snow an 11 megapixel selfie camera theyboth do ultra wide selfies now insteadof just the pro love that and video isslightly better too including 10-bit HDRtough to show that in this SDR video butif you've seen HDR video before you knowwhere this excels already anything withbright specular highlights loads ofdynamic range Etc it's still a stepbehind the iPhone when it comes to noiselevels and autofocus so for thosecurious why I still put the iPhone asthe overall king of smartphone imagerythat's why but this is not far behind byany means okay here's a couple othersmall things that didn't fit into therest of this review the speakers on the7 Pro are slightly louder but slightlyless Bassy than the 6 Pro just a littletinier so a little less low end for alittle bit more vocal Clarity I foundthat interesting and then there's not awhole lot going for sustainability forthese phones other than the metal visorand frame being made with 100 recycledmaterials some pretty specific wordingthere but also the box that comes inwhich doesn't have a charger does comewith a cable and an adapter and is fullyrecyclable cardboard and then a bigquestion are there bugs because my pixel6 experience was a roller coaster I meanI I love the phone to start but thenit's slowly descended into having moreand more bugs until I it was likeunusable to me and I stopped using itthen it got some updates that squashedthose bugs and then I ended up dailyingit for like the last two months or so soall their bugs on the pixel 7s yeah Ihave found some I mean I had this mediaplayer bug where it just shows a blankspace where the media player is supposedto be whether or not there was any mediaplaying that did go away after rebootthere was also this weird thing whereafter you hit the X in the Google searchbar that button just disappears but it'sstill pressable for some reason also Itried to post the Instagram story fromthe pixel 7 Pro the other day and itjust looked like this for some reasonhonestly no idea what happened hereeveryone saw it apparently some peoplethought it was an ad for dbrand's newdigital camo it wasn't but this is heyif your new metal bar isn't enough andyou want your new pixel to look evenmore different from the rest Channelsponsor dbrand's new skin is pretty sickand it's a foolproof way to make yourphone look unique plus it hopes to hidethat dust that sort of naturallyaccumulates right above and below thecamera bar so link below of course rightbelow that like button but I've reallyenjoyed using the pixel and that's whyit's going in my pocket as my dailydriver phone for now anywayas far as whether you should get one ornot I think the real question is howmuch money are you willing to spendbecause same prices as last year 5.998.99 and I think my initial feeling is Istill feel the same which some peoplegot kind of Twisted by the way but the300 difference between these phones thepixel 7 is a way better deal than the 7Pro like they're both well priced andthey're both very competitive andfrankly undercutting most of whatthey're competing against but the sevenis just for most people a no-brainer souh this is the phone I'm gonna berecommending more often probably a valuephone of the Year Contender again lookthere's a lot of stuff Google didn't dowith the pixels like they didn't dosuper fast 80 watt charging they didn'tdo multiple telephoto cameras it doesn'teven fold in half right there's a lot ofstuff but for patient Pixel People Whoprefer pristine programming and prettypictures the pixel Pro ispretty perfect[Music]
nAa4Ngpes44,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"What's going on, everybody? The Pixel 6 Pro is as close to perfect as it can get. This is a solid phone. This feels fresh. Google developed their own processor called Google Tensor. It's plenty capable.The amount of techWow.Switching around applications, loading data, automatic translations, wow, all of that processing so good.You can actually turn off your cameraand turn off your mic access right here.Good for that peace of mind. The battery is solid. I'm using the camera, I'm working on social posts on Twitter, I'm watching videos on YouTube. I'm really happy with the battery. Pixel 6 Pro comes with a main50 megapixel, 12 megapixel ultra wideand a 48 megapixel telephoto.Shots come out bright and detailed.Magic Eraser is a new feature that lets you eraseobjects in your picture. It's like it never was there in the first place. In my testing, darker skin tones is just more accurate.Look at this, the skin tones are just muah.To me, this is the best Android phone out right now. I would say the Pixel 6 Pro is a fantastic buy. Bravo Google."
pWyu6Dmzw_g,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"- Hello everyone.Instead of throwing out a one day reviewof the Google 6 Pro,I wanted to take a full two weeksas using it as my daily driver,and also take over a thousand images using it,to really get a good idea of how this one performs.Let's get started by rolling the intro.(birds chirping) (water rippling)For those of you who are new to this channel,I'm Loïc Bellemare-Alford,a young photographer and filmmaker on the journeyto becoming better at this art.Before getting started with this video,I want to make a few things here.So first of all,I bought the Google 6 Pro with my own moneyand have no sponsors for this video.I also consider myself being mostly a photographer,so this video is going to be really gearedtowards photography and video of the Google 6 Pro.I've tested the camera in multiple conditionsand cannot wait to go out tomorrowand do a hike to test this camera even more.(woodwind music begins)Now let's talk about the design build qualityand performance of the Google 6 Pro.I didn't really like the design of the camerawhen I saw it on the rendersbecause it has a camera barthat spans the whole width of the phone.But after using it for two weeksand especially with a case on it,I can say it's not a big deal at all,you barely notice there is a camera bar in the back.Having a full width camera bar has actually one advantageis that when you put it on the table or lay it tilted,it actually doesn't wobble as much as other phones.Overall, the phone has pretty good build qualityand also feels pretty premium.Yes, you can feel the seams on the side,but that's not a big deal in the end,especially if you put a case onbecause you never noticed them in the end.One of my biggest problems with this phoneis that it's super, super, slippery in the hand.This is a specialty a problemfor somebody like me with smaller hands.When you take it out,you feel like it's going to fall each time.That's why I have a case on it right now.I definitely prefer the size of the Google Pixel 4,making it much easier to have it inside of my hands,but I don't really mind having a bigger phoneif it means having bigger cameras in the end.(upbeat music)(camera clicks)(upbeat music continues)If you've seen any of the reviews of the Google 6 Pro,you probably have heard about the fingerprint scannerand people are complaining about it.The good news is that Google came outwith an update last weekthat makes it much better and much faster.I still prefer the rear fingerprint scanneron the Google Pixel 4a,but I must say that update makes it much fasterand also makes it much more accurate,which is much more important.It works now 95% of the time,instead of working one time out of two,like it did a few days ago.(quirky music)(camera clicks)(quirky music continues)We can not talk about this phone without talkingabout its huge screen.I didn't have any problems with the curved edgesand the content on the screen looks beautiful,especially when you're looking at your photos and videos.I don't really notice 120 Hertz,but it does help making the whole interfacelook a lot more responsive.I'm not someone that judges the performance of a phoneby doing some benchmarks,instead, I try using the phoneand seeing if it's fast or not.This phone is very fast and it had no problems at allfor most of my tasks, including some photo editing.This is not surprising because the processorinside of the Google 6 Pro is as fast assome of the fastest ones from Qualcomm,and also has 12 gigabit of RAM.The only place where I did have some slowdowns,is editing some funky footage from the Google 6 Proin the end it is your app.But that's not very surprisingbecause even my computer has a hard timewith 4K footage from the Google 6 Pro.What is much more impressive in my opinion,are the AI features that the Tensor chipbrings to the Google 6 Pro,without having to be connected to the internet.My favorite feature is one that not many people talked aboutand it's a much more powerful auto-correct,it the works a little bit like Grammarlyor Microsoft editor,where it doesn't only correct words that are misspelled,but also correct words in the contextwhen you're using them inside face.You also have all the other AI powered experiencesthat make Pixel devices so unique.I've been using the costume screen optionsfor the last few years and really enjoyed it.What really surprised me is that a few days ago,I called my bankand I started seeing options on the screen appear,and I could simply click the options on the menuinstead of having to touch the phoneor set the options on my phone, which was pretty cool.One of the problems I have with the phoneis actually the battery life.Okay so I was going to complain that the battery lifeof the Google 6 Pro is terrible,but it's actually been fixed when the last update,so now I get about 40% to 50% at the end of the day,even when I take a lot of pictures during the day.So I have no problems at allusing the battery on this device.(Upbeat music)If you're enjoying this video,why don't you let me know by handing like button below,you should also subscribe to the channelbecause I'm going to have much more videos on the Google 6 Pro,including some comparison with my DSLRand also the Google Pixel 4a.If you haven't checked my Instagram account,you should I still go check that one outbecause I'm going to be posting more picturesfrom the Google 6 Pro right there.(upbeat music)Now let's talk about the real reasonwhere getting to Google pixel 6 Pro,and this is for its cameras.So it has a main sensor at 50 mega pixel F1.85,a 48 megapixel telephoto lens at F3.5,and a 12 megapixel ultra wide at F2.2.What is very important to understandwith these camera lensesis that you cannot get a 48 megapixelor a 50 megapixel image, in the end,it does pixel binding, like I predictedwhere it takes four physical pixelsand then merges them together into one final pixel.So this means whatever camera app you're going to be usingon your phone, you're going to end up havinga 12 megapixel photo, in the end.What is much more interesting about these camera lensesis how big they are, at one over 141 inch and half an inchfor the main and telephoto lens,it's allows to capture much more light inside of the photos.It also means that you're gettingmore natural depth of field,but more about that a little bit later in the video.The Pixel 6 Pro also has a new sensor for the front cameraand also new lens with a wider field of view,and also much bigger image qualityfrom the front facing camera.It's still a fixed focus lens, but more about that later.(upbeat music)Let's do a quick walkthrough of the camera app,if you're a Pixel user, it's going to look very similarto the previous versions of the camera app.But if you look at the bottom here right now,we're going to see that you have an optionto select the ultra wide lens right here.And then you can also select the telephoto right from here.We also have an option on the left,if we click on the screen right hereto select if the image is cooleror warmer instead of the shot,and we still have our options to select how the shadowsand the highlights look individually, which is really coolbecause you get a lot of controlon how the final image is going to look.If you also look at the auto focus here,we can actually select an object,is going to track it automatically.So this is very cool because evenif you move your phone a little bit around,it's still going to be checking that objectand making sure that's perfectly in focus.If you look at our more advanced options right here,we first have the option to use Night Sightas our default option when it becomes a little bit darkerso it's going to be using Night Sightinstead of using the flash, which I think is really cool.And as your option hereis that we can select some raw images.So this is really usefulbecause it doesn't only put a raw image,it also use the other computer photographybefore saving the raw image,which means you get a super, super high quality raw image,that you can edit it afterwards to get exactlythe look that you want.(quirky music)Overall, the Google 6 Pro tendsto produce consistently great photos.The HDR is top-notch allowing to get a lot of detailsand also information instead of the brighterand darker parts of the image.The image processing from the Google phonedidn't really change from the previous versionsof Google Pixel phones,but it's not a bad thing because Google was alreadyreally good at image processing.The two main problems with this photos from this phoneare actually that its color tend to be a little bit moreon the blue and magenta side.And also that the imagestend to be a little bit over sharpen.It's not really a problemif you're looking at them on your phone,but it is one when you bring them on your computer.(upbeat music)Camera is by far the best one on this phone.At 24 millimeter equivalent, it's wide enoughto get a lot of things inside of your shot,but not too wide to be, and not so wide to worry.with an aperture of 1.85,you also get some natural background bluror what we call bokeh.This is very important inside of photograph,because it allows you to guide your eyesto certain parts of the image by making the foregroundor the background of your image more in detail,and the other apart blurry.I have a few example here where I'm going to showwhere I take the foreground in the backgroundand how different they are depending on if the foregroundor the background are in focus.The main disadvantages of having such a small apertureis actually, that you're gettinga lot of the parts of the image that are blurry in the end.This is a specialty or problemif you're taking pictures of things like flowers,you might have your main flower in focus,but the ones that right around completely blurry.So this definitely something to keep in mind,and it's very important that you use tap to focusto make sure that the camera knows exactlywhich part of your photo should be focusedand which one shouldn't.(quirky music)I know, I know I use a complaint that I prefergetting a telephoto lens and the ultra wide lens,but in a situation like this,it's actually really usefulhaving a 60 millimeter equivalent lensto get more information out of the shotand just get more things that showthat's a more massive scene.The two problems that have with the ultra wide lensis first of all,that's a little bit over sharpen in most of the images,again, not a big deal if you're lookingat the pictures on your phone, but really a big deal,if you're looking at them on the computer.And the second thing is that there's a little bittoo much over processing,which makes some parts of the image that should be darkeror lighter in grey in the end,which doesn't really look good, and this is a problembecause Google is just trying too hardto keep some details and some parts would be okayto have a little bit more contrast inside of the image.My favorite lens is by far the telephoto lens.I think most people underestimate how useful it isbecause it allows to get some more detailsinside of the imageand also focus on some parts of the imageinstead of other ones.And 106 millimeters,this is about a four times optical zoom.My biggest disappointment is I was expectingto have an optical zoom between two to four-times,we could move inside of it,but instead it's locked at four-times zoom.This is a problem because the two-times zoomis only digital, which meansthat it's not a great quality of zoom at two-times.With that being said,the four-times telephoto zoom looks really greatand has very similar image quality to the main camera lens,which is really great.Again, Google seems to be over sharpening the images,but in case sometimes it looks perfectly fine,and in other ones, it just looks completely over sharpen,so it's hard to know when it's going to look good or not.I got multiple questions about using the telephoto lensto do some macro photography,and I definitely wouldn't recommend this using this phone.The problem is that, the minimum focus,this is actually quite far.So a lot of the times, if I were trying to focus too close,it just wouldn't focusand ask me to move back to get the focus working.So this is definitely not a good optionfor some macro photography.Another problem to be aware of is that actuallyhave to hold the phone pretty steadyto get some photos that are not blurrybecause you moved it a little bit.Another problem of the system is actuallythat the optical image stabilization inside of the phonemoves a little bit around.So when you're composing the shot with four-times zoom,sometimes the image is just like jumps around,which is a bit weird and makes a little bit harderto compose your shot perfectly.I think it's a shame that Google doesn't addits telephoto lens to all of its other phone,because it's actually a really useful lens to havethat a lot of people could use in all kinds of situations.(upbeat music)♪ Ye ♪♪ Ye, ye ♪The Google 6 Pro has two new AI powered modethat allowed to get a much more advanced effects.Long exposures and motion pan, both of these modes are workby analyzing the motion inside of your shot,so for motion pans analyzingwhat is moving at the same speed as a cameraand blurring the background and for long exposure,it's another thing, what is movinginside of a shot and blurring that part.This is very cool for a scene like right now,we have the waterfall in the backgroundwhere you want to get the whole waternice and smooth inside of the shot.Both of these are pretty hard to get using a DSLR,so it's really cool, I can click one buttonand get the results inside of the Google Pixel 6 Pro.I'm going to have a more in-depth video to explainhow both of these modes work and how you can get themif you don't have a Google 6 Pro,but more about that in the next few weeks.(upbeat music)♪ Ye ♪♪ Ye, ye ♪Another AI power mode, inside of the camerais the portrait mode.But I must say I'm a little bit disappointedbecause the results are very similarto what I was getting on my Google pixel 4a.I was expecting to get much better resultsof the tensor chip inside a Google 6 Pro,but it's not the case, you get the same problemswith edge detections and things like that.It still works really well in most cases,but sometimes it just has a hard timegetting the edges of some of your subjects.One upgrade that was really nice inside of this phone,it's actually the front facing camera on this phonewhere you get a lot more dynamic rangeand it's night and day compared to Google Pixel 4afront facing camera, and also the wider lensmeans that you get sharper images of yourselfwithout having to hold the phone as far away.So this is a really nice update,if you're taking a lot of selfie photosor using the front facing camera.(quirky music)My favorite features on the Google Pixel phonesis actually Night Sight.If you don't know what is Night Sight,it basically allows to take pictures in the darkby taking a picture for a few secondsand then processing it afterwards.The final result is very detailed and also sharp images,even in very dark conditions,these pictures would actually be really hardto take using a DSLR,so it's pretty impressive that a phone can do this.And it also presents surpriseto realize that it works on all lenses,so including telephoto and the wide-angle lens,but it works best on the main camera lensbecause the other ones are not as sharpand detailed in the end.Also has an (indistinct) photography modebut I didn't have to test it out.So that's going to be for another video in the coming weeks.Google 6 Pro also has to have two other camera modeswhich are panorama and photosphere mode.I honestly don't really use either of them,they're not the best image quality in the end,but if you want to take a panorama or (indistinct)view photo, you can, and they're built in,so it's pretty nice that they're right there,just a few taps away.(water rippling)If you're a bit scared that I've you seen me under the raindon't stress, I think this phone is rated IP68,so it's not a problem at all to be filming under the rain,but I'm going to have to go back homeand finish filming this video at homebecause I actually cannot film the rest of videobecause the other cameras are not waterproof.(opening the cars door)(car engine revving)Okay, so now let's talk about the last photo featureand this one is Magic Eraser,you're going to see this one is actually pretty cool.So if we go inside of Google photos here,I have a picture of Trevor, and let's say,I want to get (indistinct) Trevor of the picturebecause he was a tourist or something like that.Now we can simply go inside of the edit tab right here,then go inside of the tools,select Magic Eraser, is going to tell usthat to remove somethings out of the image,it can be a person, It can be an object,it can be pretty much anything.All we have to do is draw a circle aroundthat person or object.So here we're simply going to draw a circlemore or less around him,and we're going to see right away,it's going to detect who he is and remove him.A little trick now, is that we're going to seeit didn't work perfectly.So if we want to try and make it even better,we can come back here, zoom in,and then circle around the parts that we're missing hereand just try and correct it until we get somethingthat looks a little better.So here, I'm just going to go through a few timesand if we zoom out, we see this is looking pretty good.So this is a feature that's very similarto what we have inside of Photoshop.So it's already something I used to do inside of Photoshop,but here it's really simple.All you have to do a circle on objectand it disappears almost magically.It doesn't work perfectly all the time,you need to have something in the backgroundthat is repeatable, so you want to have some patterns,some colors that are easy to replicateor something like that.And if you're trying to remove somethinga little bit more complex, it's not always going to work.And sometimes it looks really bad.So for more complex cases, you're not going to have a choiceto still go inside a Photoshopor a more advanced software like that.But it's really cool that now it's built in insideof a Google photos.I can really see this being useful,if you want to go in a tourist spot,take some pictures and then just remove the touriststhat are inside of your shot.Let's finish by talking about the video.Google has finally fixed or over sharpening issue,and the video looks really goodand I'm actually going to start using itinside of these YouTube videos,which I didn't do from a Google Pixel 4a,because if you do, just wasn't good enoughfrom that camera.All main cameras on the phone can actually film in 4K,including your front facing lens,so this is a really nice upgrade.The only limitation is actually that only the main cameracan film at 4K, 60 frames per seconds,all the other ones are limited at 4K, 30 frames per second,but didn't have any overheating issues or things like that.So that's a really nice upgrade herethat they can also shoot in 4K, without much of a problem.The video also supports HDR,which is a really nice upgradebecause that means you're getting more detailinside of the shadows and the highlight of your image,creating overall a much better video,there's much more pleasant to look at.This also means that the colors in generalare much more saturated.And I would say it's a little bit too saturated to my taste,but the skin tone (indistinct), that's still of a good,so that doesn't really annoy me,that they oversaturated a little bit too much the video.You can also switch betweenthe different lenses while filming,so this is a really nice thingif you want to get closer or move back.But the only thing you need to know is thatwhen you're jumping from the one-time zoomto the four-time zoom,you actually have this weird jump between the two,because the first digitally zoom then actuallyswitched the optical zoom of the four-times lens,and there's always a jump between the two,so that's not very fluid transition between the two.There are now four stabilization mode inside the video,but I use the standard one, most of the time,because it just seems to avoid the onethat works the best, in most use cases.I would say it's a huge upgradecompared to the previous Pixel phones,because the stabilization used to look a lot digitalwith warping at the cornersand all kinds of weird artifacts like that,that just didn't make it look that good.In this case, it looks a lot better.You can walk around with your phone,you still get a little bit of that up and down motion,but it doesn't look as digital or as fakeas it was in the past,but it's still not as good as somethinglike an iPhone or something like that,but it still is good enough for most use cases.And it's not going to be a huge problem anymore,and you don't have to remove the stabilizationbecause it was looking so bad in the past,like I used to do a few times.So this is a huge upgrade on the Google 6 Pro.I'm going to test the four modes a lot more in my upcoming vlogand I'm just film only using my Google 6 Pro,so definitely stay tuned for that one.Another really cool feature on the Google 6 Prois actually have speech enhancementwhen you're filming using different facing camera.And this actually allows to removesome of the background noiseand really make sure that your voiceis clear instead of the videos.The slow motion and time-lapse modes are still here,but it's really disappointingbecause Google didn't update either of them.So we really liked that they update them in the futurebecause slow motion is still a cap at 1080p,120 frames per second, but it just doesn't look good,they cropped in and the whole image just doesn't look goodand saving for time lapses, they're not smooth.They don't really look good in the end.So these are two places where Google can definitely improvein terms of video in the future.But overall, the video modes on the Google 6 Proare a huge improvement, making them good enoughfor me to use inside of my YouTube videos.So this is just a proof of how good they have become.In my opinion,the upgraded sensors of the cameras finally bring backthe Google 6 Pro to being one of the best camera phones,or if not the best.The smart features, the performance built quality,new processors and all of these thingsalso make it a flagship that is actuallypretty easy to recommend.I personally would select the Google 6 Profor the telephoto lens over the Google Pixel 6,but if $500 more is too much for you,the Google Pixel 6 is actually a great choice also,I know that $900 is actually quite expensive,but when you compare it to other flagship phones,it's actually not that bad.And it's actually cheaper than most of the other optionslike iPhones, some of Samsung device,Huawei or other brands like that.So overall it's really a phone that it can easily recommend.And I'm going to have a link down in the description below,if you want to go check out some of the pictures I took,they're going to be high resolution pictures,so you can really judge by yourselfif you think that the picturesare good or not from this phone.If you enjoyed this video,please let me know by hitting it like below,and definitely subscribe for more contenton the Google 6 Pro.If you have any questions on this phone,please let me know by dropping them down below,I'm going to try to answer to all of them.And I might even answer them in one of our next videos.See you in the next one.(upbeat music)"
vCpiuov_k4Q,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"- Well, well, Mr. Google. (chuckles)You gave us one more phone.Let's see if it takes the cake.Google's been trying to make Pixel phones a thingfor, well, five years is how long Pixels have been around.But before that, they were making Nexus phones,I think since 2010?And they just really,they've struggled with what the heck a Google phone is.Is it a really nice Android experiencethat's built by another company?Is it like an iPhone type thingthat's built entirely by Google?But now the Pixel is for the first timemore of a Google phone than ever before,right on down to the silicon.They got some sand and they molded it into their little-Look, it's the Google logo.For that reason, I've been kind of excitedabout the Pixel 6.I have a Pixel 3 because I'm a Pixel boy,and now they're finally here.So, it's time to do it.Are you ready? Are you ready, kids?- [David] Aye aye, Riley.(Riley laughing)- Whoa, it's a pop-up.Google, what are you?What, do you think we're kids?I'm not impressed.Just kidding, that's kinda fun.Let's look at the actual phones.""Google Pixel 6 for all you are.""After many years of Google Pixel phones,like the 4, 4A with 5G,and then the 5, and then the 5A,it was just kind of like, they were taking the same phoneand just kind of tweaking it a little bit,and it was never really that impressive.So, this is a major change and we are excited.Yes, honey. We are excited.Yes, honey. We stan a Pixel.I would have loved to have the Pixel 6 here,because if I was gonna buy one,I would have probably bought the Pixel 6.The 6 and the 6 Pro are actually pretty different phones:different cameras, different display, some other stuff.Let's unbox it real quick. They took a bite out of Apple.- [David] Oh.- Now Apple is bleeding on the floor.Is there stuff under here?Oh, I ripped it.(box tumbling)Pixel 6 Pro.Black, which is the only proper option.- [David] What?- To get for a phone. - Why?- You're gonna put a case on it anyway,Who cares what color it is,it's in your pocket most of the time.You want to be like using your phone and be like,""I hope everyone else seeshow good this color is of my phone.""Who cares? It's a tool.So right away, we see the most contentious partof this phone's design.This giant camera bar with like a sharp,can you see that?It's not like there's a smooth gradationto go up from the back up to the camera bump.Like it's a bump.I feel like if you're gonna do a big camera bump,you might as well make it a bar like thisbecause you set it down and it's not wobbly.It's very stable.You could build a house on there.Maybe you can't see it so good on the camera,but like you can kind of seethere's an appearance of depth to it.And that's because the telephoto lens,which I think that's the telephoto lens,uses these folded optics.It's like the Periscope camera situation.It's an op - it's an illusion. Magic.David Copperfield made this phone.I wish. It's not a bad width.I'm kind of a one-handed phone guy,and that's why I got the Pixel 3 instead of the Pixel 3 XL.It's still a bit of a stretch,but maybe I could use it, I don't know.All right, before we get too much into that,let's see what else in the box.Not a power adapter, 'cause that's the trend.Apple started it, everyone follows.We got a type C cable,and then we got a type C to A adapter,which is always appreciated.I mean, if you're not gonna have a power adapter,give me a doohickey.And then we've got a SIM removal tooland a manual or something, warranty.I'm not gonna look at that.Oh, there's a case.All right, let's put that in there. Real nice.Yeah, overall I liked the feel of the phone.I mean it's a phone.They did include this like waterfall edge type of situation.Like it's like a Galaxy S7 Edge.And I don't know if I love this,I haven't really tried a phone for a long timewith a curved edge like that. But it's there.The Pixel 6 non-Pro does not have the curved edge,so if you're not a fan, that's an option.No headphone Jack, USB type C only,hopefully, the headphone jack is coming in the 6A.Maybe I just wait for that one. I don't know.But it looks like dual speakers on the bottom,but we'll find out once we dive into the phoneand start testing out some of the features.- [Jono] Wait - Huh?- [Jono] Sponsor.- Sponsor? (laughing) - [Jono] dbrand, wear this.- (Riley laughing) Why?- [Jono] Just wear it.- I'm protected.- [Jono] Check this out.(items hitting) - Oh God what.- Pastel Orange Pixel 6 Pro back grips skin matte black.Our buddy, matte black.Oh, it's a grip case.I like the look of that. These are racing stripes.Does this make the phone faster?You didn't even hit me that time.(ball bouncing)Come on. Geez, Louise. Alright.(ball bouncing) (Jono laughing)Headbutt.Oh, it almost, am I even doing it right?(ball bouncing) (Riley screaming)- [Jono] Faster.- If you're gonna to put on the skin.if you're gonna take the time to do that,it should look perfect.(guys offscreen laughing)I mean- (item banging).- Oh. - Whoa, ah, my God(Riley yells) (guys offscreen laughing)(item banging)Never. (item banging)(sighs) Braced for that one. (item banging)There we go. Skins on boom.Alright. There you go.Deeper. (mask hitting mic)(balls bouncing) (guys offscreen laughing)(Riley heavy breathing)Alright. This thing feels secure now.And look,everyone will look at my skin on my caseand think that I'm very cool. Thanks dbrand.(guys offscreen laughing)Alright, here we go.Let's open it up.One thing that's kind of cool about Android 12 is this newmic access and camera access buttons in the quick settings.So, you can just like turn that off if you're like,""I don't want, even if my phone does get hacked,it's probably hacked right now.But the hackers can't listen or see me,thanks to these two toggles.""Alright. But the big thing about the Pixelsis always the camera.And with this one, it's the chip as well.Google tensor,but Google tensor is using its machine learning chopsapparently to enable some kindof cool machine learning type photo features.And the first one is magic eraser.So, magic eraser is basically kindof like Photoshop content aware fill for your phone.But now it's gonna be like right in your camera app.(camera clicking) Okay.Thanks Jono. (Jono murmuring)You can stay back there. Okay.(laughing) You could, I mean, actually you should probably,can you see him?You're the best Jono.You're the best Jono anyone knows.(ball bouncing)Ah, it wants me to erase the Ellie statue,that's not very nice Google.- [David] Let's try it.Try it? YeahOkay. Let's see what happens.Ah, alright.Boom.She's gone.(guys surprised gasps)Just like what happened in the game.I haven't played it. (David laughing)Don't spoil it.- [David] Dumbledore.- Dumbledore kills Ellie (laughing).(David laughing)- Well, it's been fun Jono,but you're about to enter the Nether zone, the Phantom zone.- [David] the Nether regions. - the Nether regions.- [Jono] Don't touch me- I'm gonna touch you. (guys offscreen laughing)Don't include that.Alright. It's gonna be-(guys offscreen overlap chatter)- [David] It won't do itIts a shelf with complex items-- [Riley] Boom.- Whoa. (laughing) (everyone laughing)Okay. So like, obviously that's not,that's not what the shelf looks like, but,(everyone laughing)but if you look from far away,you would have never noticed that a man had just diedand snapped out of existence. (guys offscreen laughing)I'm gonna raise the shelf. (Riley buzzing)Oh, okay.Now it just looks like there's a bunch of black mold there.What else should we erase? I feel drunk with power.I can erase anything.- Whoa. - See, that's pretty cool.I mean like, okay, I'm a Photoshop guy.I make the thumbnails for Tech Link.I'm well aware of what content aware fill can and can't do.But I know that when I've recently learned about ita number of years ago, I thought that was really cool.And now it's like,we can do the exact same thing on our phone.It takes a second.It's so quick. Plants don't need 'em.There's too many on the Earth already.Get rid of all the plants I'd say.Look at that. (Riley laughing)Oh, did you see that?I was like doing stuff there and Jono on the shelfwas like, boom (everyone laughing)Oh, if I just tap and hold it shows the original.(guys offscreen oohing)That's pretty cool. Let's-Real quick, we're gonna erase basically everythingwe can see and see- (everyone laughing)See at which point things start looking real bad.(speed up reel sound effect)- Whoa dude. - It's taking-(everyone laughing)And done. (everyone laughing)We made art today people. Nice job.Nice job everybody. - [Jono] Sell it as an NFT- (Riley laughing) We should sell this as an NFT.I mean, hey, that was pretty good.I mean, when I saw it demoed on the live stream,I was kind of like, ""Okay, but is it gonna be that good?It's a phone.""But like I would never have expected a mobile chip coulddo this this fast and this well.So, that's actually really impressive.Now, there are a couple other camera features.Let's do face unblur.Pretend you're possessed (groaning)Now jump. Jump.Yeah.- [David] Now take off your shirt.- Alright (Riley laughing) (David laughing)Okay great.You're face in all of these photoswas perfectly clear. (laughing)- [Jono] Are you serious?- So, I mean, Hey,that's saying something about the camera right there.Alright. Well, face deblur was likethe least impressive one anyways.Motion mode.So like, instead of unblurring things,you can add blur to things,and that's supposed to like make things kind of like a,you can make like an artsy waterfallwith the waterfall go on, cool.I don't know. So, let's see if it does anything with this.This is probably the best photo I thinkof you in a while Jono.Tools.There's just blur, which I guess is like,makes it a portrait thing.Oh, you need to take the photo.Wait, what?Use motion mode to take an action panor long exposure photo.Well, that's kind of annoying (laughing).So like in order to use these modes,you have to activate the mode and then take the photo.From the photos that we took duringthis whole testing processthat turned out not to be that useful.(guys offscreen laughing)The photos looked pretty good.I mean, they're Pixel photosand I think you're gonna need a deeper divein order to find out whether the photosthat this is gonna take is significantly betterthan an iPhone 13 Pro Max or whatever.I don't want to say that I'm like not expecting this camerato be good because I expect this one to be really good,especially with the new Google tensor stuff.But one of the other thingsthat was pretty impressive in the keynote is the factthat they had Marie Kondo come onand talk about live translatebecause apparently the Google tensor chipisn't just good for machine learning with photos and stuff.It's also better at doing this live translate stuffon device, I think.I think it's supposed to not use the internetfor any of this stuff.But we need someone to-Hey, Andy. (laughing) speaking of someonewho speaks a different language.Andy, would you ever consider buying a Google phone?(Google phone speaks foreign language)(beep sound)(Andy speaks foreign language)- Only Apple. Why is that, what's wrong with Google?- [Jono] It doesn't dictate it?- What?Wait.- [Google Phone] I will consider buyingan Apple mobile phone only.(beep sound)- That was so confusing.It came up with the translation right away,but then it like processed some more.And then the lady talked (laughing)(guys offscreen laughing)Why do you love Apple so much?(Google phone speaks foreign language)(beep sound)(Andy speaks foreign language)[Google Phone] Because you need to subscribe to messages.(everyone laughing)- [Riley] Okay that's understandable thoughbecause I didn't know what Mac Address was.(Google phone speaks foreign language)Yeah, alright, alright. This is frustrating.(everyone laughing)- [Andy] So it works?- [Riley] It works.Are you a big fan of Marie Kondo?(Google phone speaks foreign language)(beep sound)(Andy speaks foreign language)- [Google Phone] May I ask who is horsepower?- Horsepower? - [Andy] What?(everyone laughing)- Now someone's trying to connect.Alright. (laughing) - It works.- We got the idea. (laughing)Thanks, Andy. (laughing)(Google phone speaks foreign language)- Absolutely, I agree with you (laughing)I mean, that seemed like a little bit fasterthan I've seen it go before,but like it wasn't life-changing.So, the Pixel 6 Pro starts at $899,the Pixel 6 non-Pro starts at $599,which is actually really impressive.Google is trying to do the same thingthat Apple is doing with the iPhone,where there is like a regular iPhone for most people.And then there's a Pro iPhone that is more expensiveand it actually has a lot more interesting features.Like, there's a QHD plus display on this thing.And there's a FHD, like 1080P to be on the non-Pro.There's 12 gigs of RAMs instead of 8 gigs of RAM.So, the 6 non-Pro has a 90 Hertz display,just like the Pixel 5,but the Pro has a 120 Hertz display which I kind of,I said earlier, I'm not sure if we talked about it,but go it just like scrolling through the settings is,I feel like it's very noticeable.There's also better gorilla glass,but a little bit bigger battery.But other than that,they haven't indicated that the actual processorin the 6 Pro is gonna be any better than the one in the 6.They're not going full Apple yet with like,this is a 100% completely different phonethan the lower tier one.But they are starting to kind of get intothat territory of ""We're making a normal phoneand then we're making a balls to the wall phone.""Crab rave.(upbeat clacking music)I gotta say the stupidest thing about the bezelon the whole screen bit has been the lossof the front-facing speakers.When phones used to have speakers on both sides of the topand bottom of the phone.That was in my opinion, that was better.Let's keep going. (laughing)(upbeat music)Sounds pretty tinny for this part.(upbeat music)If I put it right next to my ear it sounds a lot better,but like when you put it on a table,that doesn't, bleh. (phone hitting table)Comparison to what, what is this?- [Jono] iPhone 13 Pro.(upbeat music)I feel like that's better, right?(music pauses) (music resumes)Oh, that's way better. (guys offscreen laughing)That sounds a little better at max volume.Huh, that might change things a bit.At max volume, the 6 Pro has more bass,I feel like it's fleshed out a little bit morewith the base and mids.But at lower volumes, this sounds pretty tinny,and this one sounds better.If you buy phones solely based onhow they sound at max volume, get the 6 Pro.- [David] Hell yeah.We are watching HDR content on Squid Game on Netflix.One second.- [David] No, then we can't see it.- I'll let you see you in one second.Have a determination.This is way darker.- Oh yeah. - That's a huge difference.(guys offscreen oohing)Is that just overall brightness or is that HDR?I think it is overall brightness.The iPhone's just brighter.- [Jono] Has a better screen.- I think everything is just darker here than this one.If you never compare your phone to another phone,it'll look great. (guys offscreen laughing)Also, there might be something with the settingsor something. We might've screwed that up.So again, that's LDT territory.This is a short circuit.(Riley banging table) Dammit.Last thing I wanted to check out was the fingerprint sensor.This is the first Pixel phone,I believe with an under screen fingerprint reader,which is pretty standardamong a lot of flagship phones these days.So, I trained it on my thumb and that was pretty quick.I mean, not much to complain about there.I still prefer the back mounted one justbecause it's so much easier to like,take it out of your pocketand unlock it as you take your phone,like to pick your phone up. - No.- Yeah. It's the most exciting Pixel in my opinion.For many years,just because of the fact that we've got this new processor,they've shaken up the design a lot.They've got some really interesting camera featureswhere in the past, they've just kind of been like,""Oh, it's better. You can take photos of stars.""But overall, very impressed.And I feel like I'm still gonna waitfor the 6A though for the headphone jack. (laughing)Alright. Well, that's it for this short circuit.Thanks for watching everybody.Hey, why don't you subscribe to They're Just Movies.- Yeah. - Just kidding.Subscribe to Tech Linked. (Jono laughing)"

though we allknow at this point they're just copyingeach other in a giant Circle till wehave the same features across everythinganyway today was Google's event and wegot our first look at Impressions andour Hands-On time with the Google pixel7 and pixel 7 Pro and the pixel watchwhich is really interesting and we alsogot a preview of a really interestinglook at the new pixel tablet so thisvideo is everything you need to knowabout all that stuff so the phonesthere's a big phone and a small phoneagain the pixel 7 and the pixel 7 Prothey very much look like the pixel 6 nowthat it's an established recognizablevisor identity but this time the visoris metal instead of glass and I don'tlove it but I also don't hate it like Iguess I was one of the few people thatreally got to liking the glass visor butI will say this time it is onecontinuous piece of metal all the wayaround with no seam and that is betterthan before and it just feels reallywell built but you can also see thepixel 7 visor is matte while the pixel 7Pro visor is glossy which I can alreadytell I'm gonna get this 7 Pro covered infingerprints also I'm just going to sayI miss accented color power buttons justthrowing that out there anyway no otherreal design surprises here but then onthe inside there is an updated set ofspecs so there they are you can pausethis if you need to but basically thebigger phone has a telephoto lens moreRAM and a bigger battery and a biggerhigher res ltpo display that's the dealbut here's something I noticed I wasn'treally mentioned even out loud duringthe keynote which is the pixel 7 displayis flat again and you can see the cutout at the top for the new Ultra wide 11megapixel selfie camera that they bothshare it's pretty sweet but the pixel 7Pro display curves over the edges a bitless than before it's just a subtlecurve now I'm really happy to see thatbut then as I mentioned in the lastvideo which was about the iPhone 14 plusand benchmarks and how the big GeneralBenchmark improvements are probablygoing to be pretty slight I was moreinterested just to see features just newinteresting features that they enable onthese new phones right and we got someand they range from kind of cool seenthat already all the way to possiblyincredible so yeah I'm going to keep myeye out on the overall performance ofthis next Generation tensor G2 chipefficiency smoothness all that but italso enables a few things a newcinematic video mode which basicallyappears to be doing the same thingApple's new cinematic mode does which istrack subjects and artificially blurbackgrounds it also enables transcribedaudio messages right in the Googlemessages app so if someone sends you avoice memo you don't have to find aplace to listen to it you can just readit in text form and it makes night sighttwice as fast it enables Face Unlockfrom just the new selfie camera and itshould be able to do all this with 20lower power consumption than the firsttensor chip but the coolest feature tome easily is unblur is what it's calledso so you have a picture that's slightlyblurry you know maybe your hands werekind of shaky or it was slightly out offocus or you just had a slow shutterspeed or something happened it's blurryit's soft normally you throw photo outbut you don't have any other pictures ofthat moment and it was just too perfectand you kind of just want to save it orfix it so you can open that picture onthe pixel 7 or 7 Pro and you hit thatbutton and the tensor chip goes to workand it basically fixes the picture ituses AI it recognizes subjects andsharpens things up and it does a reallygood job you can see a before and afterhere of some of the pre-loaded photos Iwas trying at the event and they aregenuinely impressive and the cherry ontop is so you have to have a pixel 7 or7 Pro to do this for now but you can dothis with any picture in your entireGoogle photos Library any photo you'veever taken or even any photo you justsave or have on your phone anything Ican see people like remastering oldPolaroids or like 30 year old yearbookphotos just whatever else is in yourlibrary that you want to saveseems pretty cool I'm going to betesting it for the full review to seehow well it actually works withnon-presupplied photos but I wasimpressed but then really mostly otherchanges that were interesting aboutthese phones came in a camera departmenton the pro phone so there's a newultrawide with autofocus just on the prophone that is 21 wider and should beable to take some pretty decent macrophotos now with these Focus pixels andthere's a new 5x telephoto camera that'salso huge 48 megapixels again and thenthey've worked a lot of software magicwith making the in-between marks muchmore usable so for example the 2x buttonhere will crop into the middle 12megapixels of the main camera for a niceclean Zoom sound familiar but then the10x does the same thing so the 10x Zoomis really just cropping into the middle12 megapixels of the 5x telephoto cameraso again hopefully a nice clean zoom andthen a lot of super resume softwaremagic and hopefully sharpening thephotos of in between those numbers butthere's also haptic stops in the cameraUI to make it easy to hopefully hitthose nice Clean Magic numbers and theyalso added a zoom preview thing for thefurthest extremes of Zoom like Samsungdid so now when you're taking thosesuper creeper shots at like 30X it'll benice and stable and easy to frame mybiggest question is did they price thesecorrectly because they went with thesame prices as last year which is 5.99for the small phone and 8.99 for the bigonewhich okay it's the same I have afeeling 300 is going to feel like a biggap again like this is what we weresaying last year for 300 extra dollarsover the small phone you're gettingbigger screen nicer battery and atelephoto cameraand that's kind of it this year it feelslike a tiny bit more it's screen batteryand then like a whole Pro camera systemwith a better ultrawide and a bettertelephoto with lots of Zoom stuffbut is that enough300 I I don't know we'll see I just havea feeling that the the seven will feellike a good deal and then a 7 Pro willfeel like a tougher sell again but thenwe also finally got to see the Googlepixel watch this is the thing that'sbeen kind of hyped a lot I got to spenda little less time with it but I'm veryinterested in reviewing this particularwatch so this might be a hot take but Ithink they did a b-plus job on thedesign I think it's really nice uh thefull circle is great it's just one sizewhich is pretty small and verylightweight there's three colors blacksilver and gold and definitely doesn'tlook like a computer on your wrist likesome others can it can be a superinconspicuous little puck of a smartwatch there's just two buttons the crownwhich can also scroll and then a buttonright above it and the way the watchbands connect to the watch is prettyneat it's a little bit finicky to me atfirst but I suspect it just takes somegetting used to and the result is justthis super seamless look with no lugswhere it looks like the band just kindof pops out the top and the bottom ofthis circle now here's why I say B plusand not a plusbezels and battery so they curve theglass right over all the edges and keptthe UI mostly black which is reallythoughtful because most of the timeespecially in lower lighting it lookslike it's basically a seamless displayon your wrist most of the backgroundsare black most of the UI elements looklike they're designed around sort offading in and not overlapping the edgestoo much and even when they do overlapthey have this nice little gradient eventhe flashlight app has a fade all theway around so you don't really think toohard about the bezel it's smart but ifyou catch the Light just right or maybeyou're outside a lot then yeah you cansee the bezel which is clearly not thesmallest thing in the world okay finebut I'm actually a little bit moreworried about battery life so they seton stage up to 24 hours of battery whichyou know knowing these companies isprobably generous like that's probablymaybe best case scenario without thealways-on display maybe one workout andI mean this watch is truly tiny it'svery Compact and light like there's justno way you can have a huge battery in itbut I think it's a good idea tosubscribe to be among the first to seethe full review when it goes live and Iget a chance to really test itfunctionality wise though it is verymuch a Fitbit Smart Watch like I thinkit might be more of a Fitbit than a lotof people were expecting but you knowsmart watch wise it does all the normalstuff notifications custom watch facesGoogle pay with wallet Google Mapsdirections Google Assistant to settimers play some music Etc it's wear OSbut then it's Fitbit for all the fitnessstuff which there's plenty of so ifyou've used a Fitbit you already knowabout the workouts and mindfulnesscontent and health metrics and sleeptracking and a sleep score and it hassome really high frequency heart ratemonitoring one reading every singlesecond but other than the specificallythe heart rate monitoring stuff it usesthe Fitbit app for all that stuff so notGoogle Fit what happens to Google Fitunclear actually but the watch comeswith six months of Fitbit premium forfree and that you just interact with allthis data just like it's a Fitbit soyeah it's a it's a Fitbit smart watch orit's a smart watch with Fitbit on topfor all the fitness stuff so it's 349for the Wi-Fi only and 400 for cellularso that means it's more expensive thanthe Apple watch SE it's more expensivethan the Samsung Galaxy watch 5.interesting let me know which one ofthose smart watches you would considerfor that money but lastly we did get apreview of the tablet another one butthis time it did it was basically justone one really cool feature which isthat it docks to a magnetic speaker dockand becomes basically a nest Hub Max andI think this is brilliant most tabletsare just like around the house most ofthe time and Google knows this so theyjust built the ultimate house tablet Iguess I do think though that this is abit of a clue that this isn't going tobe a super high-end like iPad Pro GalaxyTab Pro super crazy premium like tabletthis is this is definitely not competingwith those like this thing will have a10 inch screen single camera whitebezels it's like this thing's designedfor the 80 of tablets that just sitaround the house and don't do too muchlike not the top few percent that aredoing Peak Performance and productivityand media stuff I'm guessing and this ispure speculation and you can quote thisI'm going to guess that this will be a4.99 tablet like that's how I see thisand then you'll buy the doc extra butwe'll come back to this clip and see ifI was right but yeah stay tuned for thereviews happy techtober thanks forwatching this oneand I'll catch you guys laterpeace[Music]
pyTdHM6HjuQ,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,Hi everyone Aaron here for Zollotech and the  pixel 6 pro and the iphone 13 pro max are the  top of the line flagship phones from google  and apple this year and i want to help you  decide which would be best for you and which  one you should choose now the overall price  is fairly similar if you start at the base model  where the pixel 6 pro comes in at 899 dollars  and goes up to 1099 dollars that gives you the  option of 128 256 or 512 gigabytes of storage  however with the iphone 13 pro max it starts at  the top of the line price of the pixel 6 pro at  1099 and goes up to 1 599 you have 128 256 512  or 1 terabyte options now when it comes to the  colors of the phones the pixel 6 pro comes in  stormy black that i have here as well as cloudy  white and sort of sunny with the iphone 13 pro max  we have similar colors to last year's models with  silver gold and graphite but we have this  new light or sierra blue color that they've  changed from last year's pacific blue now when  it comes to the overall build they're definitely  different the pixel 6 pro is made out of aluminum  has gorilla glass victus on the outside edge and  seems to be pretty sturdy but definitely is  a little bit thinner and rounded off around  the corners so it has a very different feel with  the iphone 13 pro max you have polished stainless  steel on the outside edge and then ceramic shield  on the front of the phone to keep it from breaking  or scratching so both of them seem to be fairly  durable when it comes to scratches and breaks  but in general they're both glass front and  back one's aluminum one steel one is squared  off and one is rounded around the corners when it  comes to the button placement on the iphone it's  where it's always been these the power sleep wake  button is on the right hand side we also have the  power sleep wake button on the right hand side of  the pixel but we have a volume rocker below that  apple has put the volume rocker on the other  side we'll take a look at that in a moment  on the top of the phones not really anything going  on but on the 6 pro the pixel 6 pro we have a  microphone on the other side of the phone we have  volume rockers and a silent switch on the iphone  but nothing other than the sim card tray for  the pixel 6 pro on the bottom of the phone  the pixel 6 pro uses usbc where the iphone  uses lightning and then you have your speaker  and microphone so a lot of similarities but some  differences with ports both of them support fast  charging and wireless charging we'll talk more  about that when we talk about battery life  but you do have wireless charging on both of  them as far as overall weight the pixel 6 pro  is 7.41 ounces or 210 grams where the iphone 13  pro max definitely feels a little bit heavier  at 8.46 ounces or 240 grams you can notice the  difference it's not a giant difference but there  is a difference and as you can see the pixel 6  pro is slightly taller than the iphone 13 pro max  but when it comes to overall width they're very  similar especially if you take into account that  camera notch on the iphone and the camera bump  or sort of visor that we have on the pixel 6 pro  so there's a difference there as far as the camera  layout of course you may like it you may not but  the thickness is very similar if you take into  account the camera bumps if not the pixel 6 pro  feels much thinner because of the curved edges now  both of them do support dual sim card setups where  the iphone supports dual e sims this year and then  one physical sim or you can have a combination of  them the pixel 6 pro supports a physical sim and  a singular e sim so that's a little bit different  when it comes to the displays the pixel 6 pro  and iphone 13 pro max have 6.7 inch displays  the pixel 6 pro is 1440 by 3120 as far as the  resolution with 512 pixels per inch it supports up  to 120 hertz and can go from 10 to 120 hertz for  battery savings has hdr a high brightness mode and  an always on display if you lock the phone you  haven't always on display with the pixel 6 pro  you also have a fingerprint to unlock it now  this is fairly slow in many tests sometimes it  completely loses my fingerprint altogether so you  can see here sometimes it takes it's fairly quick  it's optical but then other times it's very slow  so if i put my thumb down sometimes there's a  half a second delay up to a second delay it just  depends on when you're using it with the iphone  13 pro max we have a 6.7 inch display like i said  apple calls this their super retina xdr display  with 120 hertz pro motion so the same 10 to  120 hertz refresh rate but it's 2778 by 1  284 pixels at 458 pixels per inch it also has  hdr has true tone a thousand nits brightness  of regular brightness up to 1200 nits with hdr  so they're both very bright very good displays  they're easy to see outside and they both have  120 hertz refresh rates however one thing i've  noticed in using both of them is if you're  sensitive to pwm the pixel 6 pro seems to  be worse when it comes to that you can actually  pick this up under frames per second slow motion  you can see the difference here it's a little  bit harder to pick up on the iphone and i find  that the iphone doesn't bother my eyes as much if  you are sensitive to this so the display is always  flickering to control brightness you can't see it  with your eyes but as you increase the brightness  it flickers faster or not at all at its highest  brightness and as you bring the brightness down  it flickers slower giving more time for it  to look dimmer in between so that's what's  going on to control the displays it's definitely  noticeable on the pixel 6 pro it seemed to be more  of a strain on my eyes with the pixel 6 pro so  that's something to take into account now like  i said with unlocking the iphone 13 pro max when  you unlock it the 13 pro max is nice and fast with  face id however not everyone likes face id and  many wish there was touch id however the touch  id in pixel 6 pro isn't as good as maybe samsung's  with the sonic sensor or some other optical sensor  versions i've seen before it's not as good as  the pixel 5 with the fingerprint sensor on the  back either so it's something that i've had to  reprogram my fingerprints with multiple times  i'm not sure if it's just could be something  that's fixed in a software update but i have seen  that issue face id isn't my favorite either but  it does seem to be fairly consistent and nice to  unlock when you're unlocking maybe passwords and  things like that now both do allow for hdr content  to be watched on youtube and also i wanted to have  you listen to the speakers so you can hear those  so let's go into one of my comparison  videos with some music and take a listenso hopefully that gave you a good idea of what  they sound like now the pixel 6 pro went nice  and loud however the 13 pro max seem to be  a little bit louder and also a little bit  clearer at the highest of volumes however if you  back those volumes off a little bit they're very  similar in their overall sound with the pixel 6  pro the speaker on top does a good job of giving  you a nice stereo sound as well as the iphone does  as well so you have a really nice stereo sound  from both of them and the bass is surprisingly  impressive for just being within a phone  now internally we have different specs within  both of them google is using the new tensor  core or their google tensor with a titan m2  security co-processor and 12 gigabytes of ram  that's what the pixel 6 pro has where the iphone  13 pro max is using apple's own a15 bionic cpu  that has six gigabytes of ram now google's new  tensor core is really a great processor but it's  basically another arm processor that they've  helped design with sort of their specifications  in mind so i would expect it to perform around the  the top of the line qualcomm snapdragon processors  apple's own processor the a15 so far they've been  unmatched as far as just pure processing power and  what they're capable of whether that be games  or augmented reality and more they seem to have  much more power when it comes to that overall  since it's directly dedicated for the software on  the device i do think we'll see bigger increases  in the future with the pixel lineup since this is  google's first attempt at a chipset and i think  things will get closer and closer in the future  but both perform really well but as far as other  specs such as wireless well the 6 pro has wi-fi  6e bluetooth 5.2 with dual antennas and ultra  wideband the iphone 13 pro max has 802.11 a b  g n ac and ax or wi-fi 6 just like the 6 pro  but no wi-fi 6e it does have bluetooth 5.0 and  ultra wideband when it comes to the ip rating  the pixel 6 pro has ip68 ratings however google  does not specify any depths that you can put  it in water and says that it is not waterproof  however apple says their iphone is also not  waterproof but it's water resistant ip68 for  six meters for up to 30 minutes so both of them  recommend a waterproof case or something like that  if you're going to submerge them regularly but  they should both be able to get a little bit wet  and survive that now this year the cameras have  been stepped up for both devices and as far as the  cameras are concerned both of them are pretty much  the best at different things with the pixel 6 pro  we have a forward-facing camera that is an 11.1  megapixel camera f 2.2 aperture and can record 4k  video it also can get fairly wide and i'll show  you that in a comparison a little bit later  and then the iphone 13 pro max has a 12 megapixel  camera in the notch array at the top with an f 2.2  aperture can record 4k 60 dolby vision hdr  so when it comes to video it's a little bit  better but for photos it may be about the same  and we'll take a look at it a little bit later  on the back this is where the phones get a  little bit more controversial many people  did not like the enlarged cameras on the 13  pro max but they are better than last year's  and then the pixel 6 pro gets this visor that's  fairly controversial i sort of like it since it  sets the device apart but they have impressive  cameras in both on the back of the pixel 6 pro  we have a 12 megapixel ultrawide with an  f 2.2 aperture a 50 megapixel wide f 1.85  and a 48 megapixel telephoto zoom f 3.5 with a  5x optical zoom on the 13 pro max we have triple  12 megapixel cameras an ultra wide f 1.8 a  wide f 1.5 with sensor shift stabilization  a telephoto f 2.8 with three times optical zoom  we have lidar and then also macro capability on  the ultra wide as well as a sapphire crystal lens  covering the lenses to keep them protected now  when it comes to the camera options they're both  very different the pixel has always been great at  some very high quality photos and you'll see here  this is just the general camera app and if we go  into our settings some of the settings are here at  the top where we have more light for night shift  we have top shot timer and we can change  it from a wide crop in different ratios  to a full image for three and we even have more  settings as well so we have all those typical  settings you're used to with a pixel but we also  have different modes so we have panorama photo  sphere lens and then we also have portrait we have  motion blur like i said that gives you an action  pan to make the background look like it's moving  we also have long exposure we have a portrait mode  and we also have night sight modes as well so all  of those things on the pixel 6 pro and i'll show  you a comparison in a moment on the 13 pro max we  have similar options so if we go into the camera  again photo typical photo modes with raw although  we can get raw off the pixel 6 pro then when it  comes to video again 4k up to 60 frames per second  with pro res on the 13 pro max and 13 pro and then  we have a new cinematic mode and what this does is  allow us to sort of use this in 1080p hdr and if  someone is on screen and then looks away from the  screen or looks away from the camera it will find  a different subject in the background as though  you're looking at it and as you look back it will  change it back as though you have a focus polar  built right into your phone it does work fairly  well we have different options for photos so if  you want to set up maybe different scenes that  look a little different with the different tones  and warmth we have warm and vibrant cool and rich  contrast and we can change that all in camera  both of the cameras are excellent but let me  go ahead and show you a comparison between both  the front camera and the rear cameras as wellso here's the forward-facing camera of the  pixel 6 pro compared to that of the 13 pro max  and so both of them are in 4k but you can see how  the background is handled a little bit differently  also you can hear the microphone of the pixel 6  pro here and see how it compares to the iphone 13  pro max when using the microphone as well with the  pixel 6 pro there's also a speech enhancement mode  which should clarify voice over other background  noises so there's a plane flying overhead right  now there's also some wind in the background and  so the 13 pro max typically does a pretty good job  with this but i'm curious to see what you think  is better also with speech enhancement turned onnow when it comes to the battery the pixel  6 pro actually has a larger battery at five  thousand three milliamp hours it can charge fifty  percent in 30 minutes with a 30 watt adapter and  wireless charging is possible with a 23 watt fast  charger but you need the pixel stand too with the  13 pro max it has a 4 352 milliamp hour battery  with about 50 percent charge in 30 minutes or  35 minutes and also wireless charging via magsafe  so both of them are fairly similar there they'll  charge about 50 in 30 minutes or so when it comes  to real world battery life i find that the pixel 6  pro will get me through a day but it doesn't even  come close to the 13 pro max in real world despite  its larger battery now this could be modified or  updated with future updates but the 13 pro max  gets me about 50 percent of usage or 50 of my  battery life by the end of the day where the  pixel 6 pro is definitely under 50 usually around  a quarter or so so i'm getting much less battery  life with the pixel 6 pro than i am the 13 pro max  again this could be optimized with software in the  future but right now i see some people getting  a phenomenal battery life with the pixel 6 pro  but i see much better battery life on iphone  13 pro max at least right now when it comes to  reception and making phone calls both of them seem  to be about the same they both benefit from 5g  with millimeter wave and while the pixel 6 pro is  using google phy the 13 pro max is using t-mobile  both of them have similar reception since  google phi actually piggybacks off of t-mobile  so you'll see we have about two bars or so on both  i haven't found an issue with reception on either  however i do have an occasional dropped call  on the 13 pro max the pixel 6 pro does seem to  hold the connection a little bit better when it  comes to that and has the benefit of additional  features because because of android 12 where  we have call spam protection and call screening  and also the option to have it place calls for  us and wait on hold for us that's built into the  operating system we don't benefit from that  with the iphone wi-fi seems to be about the  same on both while we do have a little bit better  overall support with wi-fi 6e on the pixel 6 pro  it's about the same for me with regular  use so no issues there when it comes to  cellular reception or anything else both are  going to get you about the same experience  now as far as the overall software well this is  going to be the deciding factor for most people  when they're picking up these phones do you want  to go with android android 12 on the pixel 6 pro  or ios 15 on the 13 pro max android 12 is very  good in the sense that it's very consistent  things are very familiar if you're using android  but also just have a cohesiveness across the os  so maybe you change your wallpaper your widgets  will change or you go into your app drawer you're  familiar with that and with the 120 hertz refresh  rate things are just super smooth all the time if  we go into our settings you'll see that things  are consistent and they're all easy to get to  and it just seems to be a much more cohesive  experience where things feel very similar to  one another all throughout the os so it's better  in some ways and right now it's on light mode but  it changes throughout the day has very similar  modes to that of the iphone but on the iphone  the the experience is well ios many  people are familiar with that as well  and some things are very similar some things are  different where the ui could be very different in  say the music app when you go into music it could  be a little bit different as opposed to well maybe  something else such as we could go into the home  app things are very different throughout the os  so it's not as a cohesive experience but they're  both very reliable and very stable at this point  i would say you're not wrong to go with either  one it's more based on what ecosystem you use  so do you need imessage and find my and do you  have a mac and an ipad well then you probably want  the iphone if you have windows and you want to  use your messenger across that and you know more  people with android and that would be easier for  you well then it's going to be better to go with  android or pixel it really comes down to what  works best for you now as they're both great  when it comes to overall speed well they're both  pretty good there if we go into the app store on  both or the play store you'll see both loaded  nice and fast if we scroll you're going to have  very similar experiences so if we scroll through  both they're both very fast no issues there if  we want to load maps it's fast if we want to go  into our widgets and maybe take a note it's fast  i've really had no slowdowns on either one of them  so if we want to go into the weather for example  you'll see it loaded at about the same pace and  one looks i think the iphone weather looks a  little bit better but you of course can install a  different app for android and then of course just  scrolling between pages and the overall smoothness  is very similar now overall speed of both devices  is quite good now the easy way to measure this  is with geekbench and this is just a generic  benchmark or a synthetic benchmark this doesn't  necessarily mean what the overall experience is  but if we go based just on numbers of geekbench  you'll see the pixel 6 pro scored 1046  where the iphone 13 pro max scored 1 740. the  multi-core score for the pixel 6 pro is 2840  where we have 4771 from multi-core on the 13 pro  max so we definitely have a faster score there  but that doesn't necessarily translate into  overall performance however we should see a little  bit better performance with the 13 pro max so if  we open an app such as real racing it's the first  time i'm opening this after installing it we'll  give it a moment to see how fast it loads we'll  set the phones down here and let's see how it goes  the pixel 6 pro loaded a little bit faster it's  already running and the 13 pro max is a little  bit behind and had a couple small frame rate drops  now this can be optimization of software but what  i'm showing you basically is that they're both  very very fast with regular use so if we go into  both get into playing you'll see tap to continue  we can tilt to steer on both and we can get into  playing so they're both going to perform equally  well with playing games and things like that no  issues there whatsoever then we can go back out  and with the increased ram in the the pixel 6 pro  they should resume more apps but if we go back in  you'll see if we hit resume right away we're back  in on both right away so they're both very fast  devices no issues there and i can recommend both  if you want to try gaming however in just those  tests the pixel 6 pro does feel much warmer than  the 13 pro max so that's just something to note  however the assistants are definitely  different and with google's new tensor chip  the voice recognition is incredible on the pixel  6 pro if you use voice a lot you'll probably want  to go this route so if we go into maybe well let's  just tap the microphone and search for something  apple.com it opens up and goes to it right  away now we can do the same here apple.combut here siri brings us to a couple different  website results and doesn't just open it up  it's more automated on the pixel so  if maybe we go into notes on both  so we'll go into google keep and then apple notes  and let's see how well it keeps up with the voice  so this is the pixel 6 pro and the iphone 13 pro  max and as i'm using both of them it's typing  what i'm saying in real time and you can see  it fill in both notes on both the pixel 6 pro  on the left and the iphone 13 pro max on the  right and so as i speak a little bit faster  it seems the pixel 6 pro keeps up about the same  but seems to get punctuation very similar to the  iphone 13 pro max and more period so if i continue  to speak it will keep up with me on both of them  and it's copying the information i'm saying real  time with my voice so hopefully that gives you  an idea of how fast and if it's accurate enough  to go back and forth and use your voice however  i find that the pixel 6 pro does a better job  when maybe you're using it to text someone and  you can say the word send it seems to get it right  more often for me so overall speed between both of  them is very similar and it really comes down to  what's most familiar to you and what works best  for you if you really value photos maybe you  want to go with the pixel 6 pro however if you  use this for more video i would probably go with  the iphone as the iphone is definitely the better  video camera here and more consistent but both of  them are quite good and if you're using them with  an external microphone for video or you just want  to take photos or you want to use them from day to  day i find them to be about the same as far as the  overall stability and reliability both of them are  great options and you really can't go wrong with  either one however with the iphone you're going to  get probably at least five years of support with  the pixel 6 pro you're going to get more likely  about three years of support and then more for  security updates so if you want long-term support  and you keep your phones a really long time you're  probably better off with the iphone although that  could change over time and so both are great  phones but i'd love to hear from you in the  comments below which one you think is best both of  them load games fast they run fast there's really  not too much of a difference between them other  than things such as shortcuts you can use the  same apps on them there's not much of a difference  there anymore so the overall experience is great  on both and i'd love to hear from you in the  comments below which one you would choose and why  if you'd like to get your hands on this wallpaper  of course i'll link it in the description like  i normally do and if you haven't subscribed  already please subscribe and if you enjoyed  the video please give it a like as

PEFUuP3eWCc,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,[Music]so the pixel buds a series the cheapestones right now cost 69nice but the old retired 2020 pixel budsbefore they stopped being sold were 179dollars and i really like them ireviewed them i thought they were nicebut they did lack active noisecancellation and so they sort of fell atiny step behind the most premium bestwireless earbuds that were out and so imentioned this at the end of my reviewthis is exactly what i said maybe laterthey'll do a some next-gen or a morepremiumpixel buds proand they'll be 279 and they'll do anoise cancellation and a bigger batteryand it turns out well that's exactlywhat we have here this is pixel buds proactive noise cancellation larger batteryexcept they're only 1.99 and actually ifyou're cool with any color other thancoral they're literally already on saleon amazon for less than the price of thelast pixel buds so just to get out ofthe way right off the top these havenailed it from every single turn fromthe case to the fit to the sound to thefeaturesyou probably just close this video rightnow and just pick up thesebut don't do that because then you'druin the watch time on this video andthen that's no fun so how about howabout i take you along and i'll show youwhy these are so good so first of allthe case that these come in is basicallythe same as before which is to sayunderrated like so many wirelessheadphones have annoyingly thick orlarger cases this is a nice compactclean well-made case sure the whitemight get a little dirty after a whilebut it's got this super satisfyingmagnet to open and close it is ipx2splash resistant as a case and it has ausbc port at the bottom but also haswireless charging so you can pop it onany qi wireless charger you already haveor on the back your phone if it supportspower sharing and that's all in apackage that fits in the coin pocket inmy jeans an all-around absolute win inthe case but it's what's inside the casethat we're here for and the pixel budspro have this new shape to them they'remostly a matte black plastic and theyhave a sort of colored cap at the endthat's either fog colored which is whati have it's kind of a light blue orcoral a yellowish green or black so justlike any other wireless earbuds you popthem out of the case you give them aquarter twist to lock them into yourears and while they don't stick out ofmy ears too bad like maybe the sonywf-1000xm4s it isn't the lowest profilei've ever seen either it's somewhere inbetween just a little bit bigger thanthe last pixel buds but the maindifference for me is these don't havethe wing tips anymore the wing tips havetheir upside in the downside the upsideis they would absolutely stay locked inmy ear much better i could run aroundand jump and they wouldn't fall out butthe tip of it when it was in my ear formore than about an hour or two wouldcreate this pressure point that wouldget more uncomfortable over time and ididn't really like that too much sothese don't have that anymore whichmeans they're not quite as locked in myearbut they are more comfortable of courseearbuds are different for everybody andwhen i switch to the larger earbud tipslike they really do still stay in my earfine for walking around normal everydayactivities and things like that but yeahthat's worth noting honestly i thinkthis is the right move also the budsthemselves are ipx4 rated so if youstill want to work out in them they'resweat proof but i just probably won't soonce it's paired up and these are inyour ears there are a lot of differentfeatures in here thanks to the pixelbuds app but i'm just going to startwith the sound you just listen to musichow do they soundand i think these sound really reallygood now i'll spare you the bunch ofdescriptors and audio file terms that icould use just to tell you basically ireally like the sound from these new 11millimeter drivers once you get a niceseal in your ear you can tell they'rereally crisp and clear they aren't tooshrill or tinny they don't distort verymuch and the noise cancellation does agreat job of getting rid of white noiseand there's basically no perceivablebluetooth lag at all when watchingvideos or gaming there's just twoslightly odd things that i noticed onethese just have a much stronger bassthan the last pixel buds i kind of notedthat as a weakness in the previous pixelbuds review like they were a little bitweak on the bass not these the bass onthese is so much stronger and punchierand just a more full low end that it's areal character highlight like so hip hopmusic anything with a lot of that lowerend frequency sounds really good but inlike podcasts or other genres or justthings where i don't need all that bassi was looking for an eq to even that outbut the pixel buds app doesn't have eqand the pixel phone also doesn't have aneq i actually got a buds firmware updatewhile i was testing these and i thoughtit was about to add an eq in the soundsettings but all it added was thisvolume eq setting which basically justmakes things a little punchier at lowervolumes so if you do specifically wantto adjust the sound signature of thesemaybe your phone has eq settings builtin some of them do maybe the app you'reusing for audio has eq settings built insome of them do but yeah pixel budsthemselves don't have eq built in yetand neither does a pixel phone butgoogle has thankfully said that there isa full five band eq coming later thisyear hopefully soon but then the secondthing i noticed is these also have aslightly lower overall volume than anyother buds i've tested in a while it'snot problematically low but i did findmyself almost always listening eitherright below max volume or like two tothree notches below the max volumebecause that was the comfortablelistening level usually max volume isway too loud for more than a few secondsof listening on most earbuds but nothere it feels like it feels like thebottom 40 of the volume slider isbasically useless i can barely hearanything that's that low but yeah i amdefinitely impressed by how littledistortion there is and how clear andthumpy and great it sounds at or nearmax volume so that's worth noting everypair of noise-cancelling earbuds shallhave a transparency mode at least seemslike they all should it's like anunwritten rule of these things yeahthese are transparency mode built intothe pixel buds proand it'sokay it's gonna let in sound from themicrophones and pump in your ambientnoise so you can hear what's around youbut it's not the best i guess airpodsare still in a league of their own whenit comes to this but i'd rate thesetransparency mode like a b minusbasically it's better than leaving themoff but it certainly still soundsmuffled and i'm hoping i'm hoping stufflike this gets better in the future ihope they can push firmware updates toalso improve transparency mode but thepixel buds real advantage to me is stilldefinitely the software and all thefeatures that are built in i still lovehaving google assistant like a hold awayor a tap away anytime i want to ask aquestion i literally just hold it downand sayhow tall is the taj mahal it's like asuperpower i can justjust start opening light shades andturning on smart lamps and things andjust yeah assistant everywhere is greatand in the pixel buds app in thesettings you can customize what a tapand hold on each side does so right nowi have the right side hold to triggerthe assistant but the left side holetoggles between noise cancellation andtransparency mode pretty much every pairof earbuds nowadays also has some sortof touch controls on the outside foryour media these are no different it'stouch wants to play touch two times toskip forward three times to go back theone thing i couldn't quite get to workas smoothly as i'd like is swiping tochange volume thesethey're just not a big enough surfacefor me to like reliably get a good swipein i kept trying to do it but this waslike the most inconsistent thing for mebasically i just end up like wobbling itaround in my ear it works sometimes butagain it's not a big surface so what iended up doing is i just end up reachingin my pocket and blindly like changingthe volume on the volume rocker on thephone in my pocket which turned out toactually be totally fine as long as myphone was on me so and there's a bunchof other features too multi-devicesupport so these buds are paired to bothmy phone and my laptop at the same timeand seamlessly switch back and forth asadvertised no problem i love that andthen they have a find my device featurein case they get lost they have in-eardetection to automatically play andpause when you take them out and putthem back in and they even have this eartip seal check feature which analyzeshow well the microphones are actuallycanceling out sound for you and if it'snot working so well it can recommend adifferent size ear tip to improve theseal it's smart the only thing missingmight be the like adaptive sound featurewhich listens to your environment andthen automatically bumps up the volumewhen your environment gets louder ididn't really use that very much but inoticed it wasn't here so that isn't inthe pixel buds pro but it's alsoapparently coming other than that it'snot really missinganything like these have every featurethat i'm used to having with earbuds andthe cherry on top as they did also withthis slightly larger body improvebattery life so you're going to getseven hours of actual listening withactive noise cancellation on which isfar longer than i would ever listen toearbuds that's up to you if you want todo that 11 hours with anc off that's ahuge advantage so for 199 should youjust get these probably yeah i mean thisis easy to recommend there are someother options out there so for aroundthis price you're looking at you coulddefinitely get air pods if you're intothat but you can also look towards ifyou specifically want better sound thereare better sounding earbuds but alsosomething like samsung's new buds2 or pro they're 229. i haven't gottenthe chance to hear them yet because theyjust came out and samsung didn't send meany but i imagine considering how goodthe previous ones were that those mightalso be really good and then also as faras like working out in headphones or fitin the ear i still prefera wing tip

fTnfRCloOP8,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"An all-new processor, enhanced security, stunning  display, speech enhancement mode, Live translate,  magic eraser, face unblur, and on and on and on.  These are the best Google Pixel 6 Pro features.Hey friends! I’m Tasia Custode and welcome back  to my YouTube Channel where I share tech tips,  app reviews, and a slightly concerning  amount of Google Tips. And you’ve wandered  into the second video of a double-header  on Google Pixel 6 Pro. Because all this  goodness couldn’t fit into one video. So I was  lucky enough to be gifted a Google Pixel 6 Pro  to review for you. And you know  I’m spilling all the details.  So, these are the best features of Google Pixel 6  Pro. We have a lot to cover. So come on. Let’s go!So first things first, let’s  talk about the new chip,  Google Tensor. This is really the  high-powered engine behind Pixel 6 Pro.Google Tensor is the first custom-built processor  designed by Google and made specifically  for the Pixel. It is such a powerful  chip. This means better, more advanced AI,  out-of-this-world computational photography,  better power efficiency ie - longer battery life,  and faster performance. Basically, Google  took about 4 years to create this chip  because they needed a chip that could  focus mainly on AI and machine learning,  yet be advanced enough to match the  performance Google required of Pixel.Google Tensor is a big reason for all  the amazing Pixel 6 Pro camera features.  And if you want an in-depth video on  the best Pixel 6 Pro camera features,  you can click up here, or find that  video in the description below.Now let’s talk a little bit  about security. Google is taking  security to the next-level in Pixel 6 Pro.If you head to settings, then security,  you’ll arrive at your security hub. The  strength of the security hub is that  it helps protect your phone, apps,  entire Google Account, and passwords. So, it  keeps all your security settings in one place  and gives you recommendations you can  take to improve your security. Plus  it’s just a quick snapshot that tells you  if there’s anything you should worry about.  You can also turn your Pixel’s mics and  cameras off, and choose when apps can use them.This next feature is a little-known one, but  helpful indeed and that’s speech enhancement  mode. This is really handy for selfie videos.Speech enhancement-mode  reduces ambient noise sound.  So, picture you’re taking a  call on a busy city street,  now your voice will be enhanced, while the  surrounding audio quieted. So, now people on  the call won’t hear as much construction or car  noise, but rather your voice first and foremost.So now let’s move on to speech and language  features. We’re talking Live Translate and Live  Caption. These are hands down some of my favorite  features. And to really showcase them off,  I’m going to show you a bit from the Google  Pixel 6 Pro launch since I don’t have  anybody to speak to right now in another  language in order to demonstrate for ya.With Live Translate, you can translate  face-to-face conversations in real time.  So Google demonstrated this brilliantly with  Marie Kondo and as they spoke to each other  in different languages, the translation  was instantly and accurately read aloud.  Amazing. But it doesn’t end there. Messages can  also be automatically translated as you type.So, think, you could be typing in English to your  relative in Italy and she will see the message  in Italian. Then if she responds to you in  Italian, you receive that message in English.  Shut the front door. Game Changer alert! Plus, you  can also translate signs with the Pixel Camera.So, simply hold your camera up  to a sign in another language  and blamo, it is translated to your  language for you. Ya love to see it.But wait, there’s more!Live Caption translation can add  on-screen subtitles to videos, podcasts,  voicemails, and voice messages.  Yes, really. How neat is that?So now let’s talk about the display. Gosh, I  love this display. I’m going to be honest  with you, it’s sexy. It’s a sexy display.This is what Google is calling their “Smooth  Display”. It’s got a 120Hz refresh rate, but also  features LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline  Oxide) technology that allows that to drop to  10Hz refresh rate for battery conservation. Google  says this will mean more responsive gaming and  scrolling. Plus, the OLED panel is curved on  the left and right edges, and features Gorilla  Glass Victus for 2x more scratch resistance  compared to last year’s Google flagship.And now let’s move on to some camera features.  This is going to be a quick overview, as I go way  into depth in my other Google Pixel 6 Pro video.  Like seriously, it’s a love story with me and the  Pixel 6 Pro camera. I’m obsessed. So, anyway,  onto a rundown of the best camera features.First up is Real Tone. Cameras  are traditionally pretty  biased if you think about it. They  are literally designed for white skin.Not cool, but now with real tone, the main  camera captures 150% more light, for rich,  vivid colors and more detail. There are improved  AWB and Auto exposure algorithms to help recognize  all faces and preserve skin tones. So now,  you can more accurately capture the true  tone of more people’s skin, from darker  to lighter and everything in between.Next is face unblur. This is great for  a subject that just can’t sit still.Pixel’s camera can unblur  a face to make it sharper,  so your subject is the focus, and you can  capture the moment unblurred. It’s actually  taking two pictures simultaneously with two of the  cameras and then fuses those pictures together,  so even in a photo where say you’re jumping,  the face is super clear. A true innovation!The next camera feature that allows Pixel 6 Pro  to take professional-level photos is motion mode.With motion mode, Pixel again takes  multiple photos and fuses them together  using computational photography and machine  learning. Pixel can identify the subject of  the photo, figure out what’s moving, and  then add aesthetic blur to the photo.  This mode is just beyond cool.  What a way to level up your photos.The last camera feature that is by far  my favorite feature is magic eraser. You guys!  Brace yourselves, because this is the ultimate!In google photos, simply  select a photo and tap on edit.  Then, scroll to tools. Here, you’ll now have a  magic eraser option. With this enabled, you can  simply circle the item you want to remove or draw  a line over the distraction to make it disappear.It’s nothing short of magic. And guess what?  You can use magic eraser on all your photos!  Whether you took them just now or years  ago. Whether you took them with a Pixel  or any other device. SAAAYYYYY  WHATTTTT!!! GAME CHANGER!I am truly obsessed with Google Pixel 6 Pro.  It’s muah, chef’s kiss. And the best part? It is  officially available now as of MY BIRTHDAY October  28th! Run, don’t walk! And remember, check out the  full camera feature video - trust me, you’re  not going to believe what this camera can do.So, what do you think of Google Pixel  6 Pro? Will you be picking one up?  Let everyone know in the comments below.  As always, thank you so much for watching,  if you liked this video, I want to  know so give it a like, a share, or  leave that comment below.

-u_2WQFk0Qk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,Hi everyone Aaron here for Zollotech and this is  the all new pixel 6 pro this is in stormy black  but it also comes in cloudy white and sorta sunny  now this comes in three different storage sizes  ranging from 128 gigabytes up to 512 gigabytes  there's also a middle option of 256. it starts  at 899 and goes up to 1099. you can see this is  the stormy black model that has 128 gigabytes  so let's go ahead and unbox it and take a look at  it so we'll pull off these little pull tabs here  and we also have a case that goes on  it as well i'll set that aside for now  let's open it up so you can see this is the  new pixel 6 pro in stormy black we'll set  this aside to take a look at what's in the  box and so we have some paperwork here if  i can get a hold of it there we go we have some  paperwork and we've got a sim card removal tool  and it's a separate little piece here we also  have a safety warranty and regulatory guide  and then probably a quick start guide explaining  what's here we also have a cable usb c to usbc  and an adapter to help us move from a different  phone to this phone so it's usba to usbc  however there's no charger in the box so if you  want to charge your phone and you don't have one  you'll have to pick one up now let's go ahead and  set this aside so we'll put the top on here set  this aside for now and let's take a look at the  phone itself so we'll take the cover off the phoneand this is a really nice phone it's actually  a little bit thinner than i would have expected  and for a quick size comparison before we  take a look around it here's the pixel 5.  so it's much bigger than the pixel 5 of course  the 6 instead of the 6 pro is a little bit  smaller but a very different design as far as  its overall thickness this gives you an idea  of what it looks like that camera bump sticks  out just a little bit there now the front of it  will turn on in just a moment but you can see  it's a much larger phone with the pixel 6 pro  now this phone let's go around the outside edge  and take a closer look and you'll see here we have  a power sleep wake button on the right hand side  along with a volume button below that or volume  rocker below that on the bottom of the phone you  have usbc in the middle and what looks to be a  speaker and microphone that are symmetrical on  either side with a little antenna line there as  well on the left hand side we have a sim card  tray and this supports dual sim but dual sim  in the sense that you have a physical sim  and an e sim as well let's go ahead and pop  that out and take a look so we'll pop the sim  card tray out here let's take a look at that  there we go took a lot of force to pull that out  and as you can see it's the little sim card tray  nothing there i'm going to put a google phi sim  card into it so we'll do that so i can use that  of course you could use that e sim like i said  and then on the other side or on the top there's  nothing other than a microphone here at the top  now for a quick size comparison with another phone  if you're familiar with an s21 ultra this shows  you the overall size so it's about the same height  it's about the same width and it's a little bit  thinner but that little bit thinner doesn't mean  it gets a smaller battery it has a very large  battery in it five thousand three milliamp hour  which is what they say is typical or a minimum of  four thousand nine hundred and five milliamp hours  so that's what's on their spec website and then  it's up to fifty percent charge in about thirty  minutes so that's pretty nice as well and then  it has google's all-new google tensor core inside  with titan m2 security co-processor so that's  something that's all new it's their own processor  design and it also has 12 gigabytes of ram so it  should be really nice and fast of course i'll have  to use it to give you an impression of that later  on now of course the main thing here is a camera  bump that's symmetrical that means it won't rock  when it's on the desk anymore and also you have a  nice camera array and google has always been known  for their pixel cameras and so what we have this  time on the back is a 50 megapixel wide with an  f 1.85 aperture a 48 megapixel telephoto which is  sort of a periscope zoom style camera and so that  telephoto camera has an f 3.5 aperture and then  we also have a 12 megapixel ultra wide with an f  2.2 aperture they can record up to 4k video at 60  frames per second so that's all built in of course  we've got that flash here and the microphone  as well now the front facing camera is an 11.1  megapixel with an f 2.2 aperture and a 94 degree  ultra wide field of view that can record up to  4k 30. now the display is really nice it's a 6.7  inch display 1440 by 3120 pixels it's an ltpo oled  at 512 pixels per inch it has a 120 hertz refresh  rate that can scale up to 120 and down to 10 hertz  to save battery and then also it's covered in  corning gorilla glass victus on the front  so that should help protect the display  it's got an always on display and hdr as  well now we have wi-fi 6e with 802.11ax  along with bluetooth 5.2 with dual antennas for  enhanced quality and connection we also have an  ultra wideband chip for accurate ranging and  spatial orientation as well as 5g with sub 6  in millimeter wave in many different bands so you  should have great connectivity around the world  if the device is available where you live now we  do have an under the display fingerprint sensor  and the display is edge to edge it sort of has a  waterfall display over the edge and then also goes  right to the bottom so we have a very narrow  bezel and then at the top you have a speaker  and again it's right up to the top so it  looks great with a hole punch display design  and then again it's very comfortable to hold  because of that waterfall display over the  edge now how this will wear over time is hard to  say as far as the design being timeless it's more  like a nexus 6. if you remember that device  i used that and reviewed that many years ago  and i think it looks pretty good overall i'm  excited to see how fast this new chipset is  and i thought we'd also take a look at the pixel 6  pro case since we have it here as well so let's go  ahead and put the phone down and open up this case  so this is a case that was sent along with it so  pull this out here and it looks like  a simple tpu case it says team pixel  and it's got this green tint to it so let's lock  the phone here we'll put the phone into the case  and this gives you an idea of what it looks like  now there'll be other versions available and it  leaves a little cutout for that camera and you  can see in the back here you have a little bit  of protection for the camera if i bring this up  here you'll see there's a little bit of a bump  and then around the outside edge of course  we have protection for the bottom ports  around the outside edge and the buttons are nice  and clicky still they're not hard to press and  we just have a cutout for a microphone i do like  the feel of the case it feels very smooth it has a  different texture than general tpu cases it feels  a little more high quality and then of course you  have that google g there as well it has a little  bit of that background color showing through it  as well which is something i actually like quite  a bit although i'm not sure i'm crazy about this  case but first impressions i really like the phone  i'm very excited for what google's doing here  they're taking design very seriously and if  you haven't watched the pixel presentation  some of the things this phone can do is very very  impressive now as far as fingerprints you can see  it it picks up fingerprints pretty easily and  that's pretty typical of a glass back that isn't  matte since it's shiny it's going to show that  of course you won't see that if you're using the  case with it as well now if there's anything you  want to know about the pixel 6 pro i'd love to  hear from you in the comments below if you haven't  seen that mentioned elsewhere or something you'd  like to know about it i'd love to answer your  questions in a follow-up video and if you'd  like to get your hands on this wallpaper i'll  link it in the description like i normally do  if you haven't subscribed already though  please subscribe and if you enjoyed the  video please give it a like as always thanks for  watching this is Aaron i'll see you next time
EGFTLLxsA6g,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Google Pixel 6 is the more affordable  version Google’s flagship phone this year and  at first glance it seems like the better  deal compared to the Pro because their specs  are so similar, but after spending a month  using the Pixel 6 Pro and now the Pixel 6,  there's actually more of a difference between  these two devices that I had originally thought.So I'm gonna walk you through what those  differences are, what makes the Pixel 6 a  great phone to get ,and when I think it's worth  it to get the Pixel 6 over the 6 Pro or the 5a.  So what are you missing out on by choosing  the six? As someone who just spent a month  using the 6 Pro and now another month using  these 6, one thing that surprised me about  the 6 was it's not significantly  smaller or lighter than the 6 Pro.The Pro has a 6.7 inch display, and the 6 has 6.4  and weighs 207 g while the Pro weighs 210 g, so  they’re very close in size. One weird thing though  that I’ve noticed when using both phones is the 6  actually feels more heavy or weighty than the Pro,  even though we both know that as an actually true.So why does it feel that way to me?  Well, there are a couple of things  going on here. The first is because the  6 Pro is slightly larger than the 6,  I think that causes you to spread your fingers out  a little bit more to be able to grip this phone.And that, plus polished metal sides of the  Pro make it more grippy to hold compared  to the Pixel 6’s brushed aluminum  sides which slip more easily and  cause me grip this phone in a different  way so it doesn't’ slide out of my hand.Now other than the build materials, size  and weight feel difference, the 6 and 6 Pro  are pretty similar in their exterior design,  with the only other main difference being  the Pro has an additional camera in the  camera bar on the back, a 4x telephoto,  and it comes in more muted colors than the  Pixel 6, and has a 5mm wave cutout included  where not all versions of the 6 do, which gives  the 6 a more uniform look with it’s design.Now, the last major difference, I found between  using the 6 Pro and the 6 are these phone’s  displays, and there's more to talk about  here than you might realize. y going with  the 6 you loose out on a curved display, which  isn’t likely a huge loss to anyone, but you do  loose out on a 120 hz LTPO display which can ramp  down to 10 hz to save battery. Most people aren't  going to notice a difference between 90 hz or  120, but if you're asking, yes I can see the  difference between 90 hz and the 120 and given the  choice, I'm going to choose 120 every single time,  But that's not actually the biggest difference  between these two phones displays. The biggest  difference is actually in display quality, which  you wouldn't necessarily know by just looking  at the tech specs of both of these phones. Just  because both say OLED display on the spec sheet  doesn’t mean the displays are actually equivalent.  In order to get the 6 to the great price of $599,  Google cut costs with the display they chose. And  unfortunately, the 6’s display is just nowhere  near as good as the 6 Pro’s. The Pixel 6’s display  suffers from color shift refractions when you just  slightly move the phone to a different angel, and  you’ll see the display alternate between a green  and purple tint, which is typical of lower quality  OLED displays and those we’ve seen in the Pixel  A series line of phones, but not in the recent  flagship Pixels like the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4 XL.So, if you’re coming from a Pixel 5 or 4 XL,  iPhone, or flagship Samsung device and are  thinking about getting the 6 over the 6 Pro, I  think twice about it and I'd steer you towards  getting the Pixel 6 Pro. Especially, if you're a  stickler for display quality, You can get around  some of the display issues on the 6 by just using  dark mode all the time, but…it's just not a great  display. So that's everything I found between  the 6 and the 6 Pro and those differences. Now  in general, what do I like about the Pixel 6? Well  first is the software experience. By going with a  Pixel 6 you get an incredible software experience  straight from Google so you can experience  Android the way Google meant it to be experienced  and for the first time this year, the Pixels have  Google-designed chips, pairing hardware and  software together to create a truly unique  experience with features you can’t get on any  other phone like the awesome new speech dictation  which is the fastest and most accurate speech  dictation I’ve experienced on a phone It's so  good, I've actually used it for this video's  captions. So if you turn on closed captions here  on YouTube, the captions you see have actually  been generated by the recorder app on the Pixel 6,  using the new speech dictation feature with  minimal capitalization and punctuation edits.The Pixel 6 also brings updated and expanded  translation capabilities as well, and its even  able to translate text conversations in real time,  as well as signs in up to 55 languages without  an internet connection, it’s all processed  on-device thanks to Google’s tensor chip.With Tensor you also get much  better video processing than  previous generation of pixels  which makes the Pixel’s video  capabilities much more in line with  iPhone and Samsung video quality.Now for a full breakdown of this  year's Pixel 6 and 6 Pro camera system,  you can actually see the full in-depth  review we did of this camera system,  which is in our Pixel 6 Pro review and you  can get to that review by pausing this video,  and clicking the card here or check out  the link in the video description below.Just keep in mind with the 6 you don’t get  a telephoto camera and the selfie camera has  a slightly smaller resolution. The selfies  I’ve gotten on the Pixel 6 look pretty good,  but they do lack a bit of detail when you compare  them to the selfies you get on the Pixel 6 Pro.Tensor also enables a brand new feature that's  been a ton of fun to play with but also one that's  quite useful and that's Magic Eraser. This  feature is a smart touch up feature that  allows you to erase objects and people from your  photos, all using the on-device Tensor processor.  So for example, here’s a selfie I took over the  weekend. You’ll notice though theres some hairfly  and powerlines in the shot that we can clean up.  To get to magic eraser I’ll go to edit, tools, and  magic eraser. When you first enable Magic Eraser  it’ll look at your image and try to determine  things that need to be taken out. So for here  it’s identified part of the powerlines. You can  click erase all and all the suggested edits will  be erased. Then I can go in by pinching to zoom  and start either circling or brushing in areas  I want it to take out and it’s smart enough to  figure out what part of the background to bring  in as a replacement of the part of the object I’m  trying to remove. This feature in my experience  actually works pretty well as long as the image  or background you’re working with isn’t too  complex and the best part is it works not  just with the photos you take on the Pixel 6  but any photo in your Google Photos library.Now before we move on, let’s talk about this  video’s sponsor Private Internet Access.

With this  Pixel you of course get all of the great  past pixel features as well like call screen,  hold for me, a new call visualization screen,  and great useability features like smart lock,  the new Android 12 themes and icon customization,  side loading apps from the web like  Fortnite, and important and useful  safety features like car crash detection,  the personal safety app which you can set  to automatically text loved ones with your  location if you don’t check in after a walk,And this year Google made a huge update  to the security area of the Pixel,  now called the security hub, which displays  all of your security settings in one place.  Google made this design very easy to use,  if everyone’s good it’ll show all green  checkmarks but if something needs your  attention either on your phone or with  an account associated with your Google  Account, it’ll show you that as well.In terms of performance and battery life.  I found the tensor chip in the Pixel 6 to  be a very capable processor. I  can capture 4k 60 video for long  periods of time without overheating  and it plays video games smoothly.The battery life on the 6 has also been fine  for me. It's lasted me well throughout the day  and do keep in mind though, I am an average  to light phone user and I haven't traveled  with this phone yet, which is usually when  I put the most stress on a phone's battery.One thing I do like with Pixels is  on the days I forget to charge it,  you can flip on extreme battery saver  to get way more juice out of your phone  and it also has Fast USB-C and fast  wireless charging included as well.So those are all of the things that I like  about the Pixel 6 and how it's compared to  using the Pixel 6 Pro. Now, let's talk  downsides and recommendations. And the  only downside I found with the Pixel 6, and 6  Pro for that matter, is Wi-Fi setup.I should  have mentioned this in my Pixel 6 Pro review  but I thought this was just some isolated bug  with my particular router set up but then when I  had it happen on this Pixel 6 and another 6 Pro,  and saw others on reddit running into this  issue, I realized there’s something going on  here. Basically, what happened to me during setup  is when I would try to connect to a Wi-Fi network,  it would just fail to connect. Even though  I typed in the correct Wi-Fi password.  I was able to get around this bug by skipping the  wifi setup step when you first set up the phone.  Then I was able to either us the QR code  scan feature from another Android device  to join the network successfully or I’d turn  off the randomize mac address setting for the  specific wifi network I was trying to join and  then was able to join the network successfullyHopefully Google’s December Pixel drop  update will help address this bug. So now let's talk recommendations and when I think  it's smart to go for the 6, over the 6 Pro or the  5a. The Pixel 5a is Google’s budget-friendly  phone for 2021 and by going for the Pixel 6  over the Pixel 5a you’ll get the all-new Pixel  6 design with a better build quality and gorilla  glass victus, wireless charging, battery share,  the new improved camera system including the  new sensor, lenses, magic eraser, laser auto  focus system, new motion modes, face unblur,  and manual white balance. You also get a 90 hz  display though both the 5a and 6 have that green  purple shift I talked about earlier. The Pixel  6 also gets you a high brightness mode, 256 GB  storage option and of course, the new Tensor chip.  The only main benefit you might find with the 5a  is its back fingerprint sensor for those who don’t  want the under display fingerprint sensor But  after using the 6 for a month and after an update  Google made the fingerprint sensor software,  it's worked much better for me and has been much  more reliable.And on the Pixel 6 you can use the  back tap feature to bring down the notification  shade in a similar way to how it works on the 5a.So that's what you get with the Pixel 6 over  the Pixel 5a and given that the cost difference  between these two devices is $150 US dollars,  I think getting the Pixel 6 is well worth it.  Now what about the pixel 6 Pro you may ask At  first glance when you consider, there's a $300  price difference between the 6 and the 6 Pro?  it doesn't seem like you get that much more,  but to me, you actually get quite a  bit more. A 120 hz LTPO display with  much better quality than the 6’ display,  more storage tier options, 12 GB of RAM,  a slightly larger sized display with more premium  materials that are more grippy without a case,  a telephoto camera that’s quality is actually  quite good and a better additional camera  than the ultrawide in my opinion, a larger  selfie camera, and stronger haptics on with  the software keyboard. Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro  to me have great haptics, but because they placed  the taptic engine closer to the keyboard  in the 6 Pro, the haptics feel stronger.To me, having much better screen quality, the 120  Hertz display, and that fantastic telephoto camera  that warrants the $300 price difference between  these two devices and warrants going for the Pro  in my opinion. Then, of course, I am a stickler  for screen quality, so that difference,  you might not be able to justify, depending  on your tolerance for OLED screens.Now if you’re upgrading  from a Pixel 5 or Pixel 4XL,  the display quality you’re used to with those  phones would make me recommend the 6 Pro over  the 6, since you’d likely find the  6’s display a bit of a downgrade.The Pixel 6 retails for the great price of $599  US dollars and you can use the purchase links on  the side of this video or in the description.  If you'd like to learn more about the Pixel 6  Pro or Pixel 5a, you can get to the reviews that  we've done of both of those phones by clicking the  cards here in this video or by checking out the  links to those reviews in the description below.If you have any further questions  about the Pixel 6, 6 Pro or 5a,  or want to share your experience with  these pixel phones, leave a comment below.Well, I hope you found this video helpful  and useful, and if you did and liked it,  make sure you hit that thumbs up button below and  subscribe to the channel for more Google product  review videos like this one.

CuV-3CR5Y4g,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"There should be a warning on this video telling people I’ve had too much fun.Like, FUN ALERT, or something.I have been snapping photos of everyone and everything with the Google Pixel 6 Pro camerafor a week now and I’M SHOOKETH.So, this is your Google Pixel 6 Pro camera review, complete with the best camera features.Is this the most advanced camera system in the world, as Google has claimed?Spoiler alert!YES.Hey friends!I’m Tasia Custode and welcome back to my YouTube Channel where I share tech tips, appreviews, and a ton of Google Tips.Me and Google, it’s a match made in heaven.And I’ve been lucky enough to be gifted a Google Pixel 6 Pro to review for you.But don’t be fooled!This is not a sponsored video.I’m telling it like it is.So come on, we have a lot to cover!Let’s go!So first things first, we’re going to talk about the camera system and what you’regetting with the Pixel 6 Pro.This is going to be your camera hardware specs.Then, you know I’m covering all the best Pixel 6 Pro camera features for you.And I’m leaving my favorite features to the end, oh you’re not going to believewhat this camera can do.And finally, I’m giving you my verdict.Dun dun dun.So, first the camera specs.Pixel 6 Pro features a 3 camera system on the back: There’s a 50 MP wide camera withan 82 degree field of view.Ya I said 50 MP!5-0, not 15, 50.I.Know!But then there’s also the 12 MP Ultrawide camera with a 114 degree field of view, androunding out the back cameras is a 48 MP telephoto lens with 4 x optical zoom.The important thing to know is that the new main sensor is larger allowing for it to capture150% more light.This means greater detail, richer color and more accurate night sight photos.In effect, your photos will look sharper and videos will be clearer, even in low light.Now on the front, Pixel 6 PRO has a larger ultra-wide 11.1 MP front camera that evenrecords 4K video and has a 94 degree field of view, which is great for group selfies.If you remember from my Pixel 5a video, the front-facing camera there is 8 MP and thatwas one of the only knocks I had about that camera.So, Google has really dialed in the front-facing camera.But more on all that later.Another important spec is that Pixel 6 Pro now allows for shooting video in 4K at 60fps, with the help of their new tensor chip, and some machine learning.And you’ve still got all the features you know and love like video stabilization too.And I’ve linked to the camera spec page from the Google store below so you can reviewall the specs in detail there.And speaking of the new tensor chip, let’s talk a little bit about Google Tensor.This is really the high-powered engine behind Pixel 6 Pro.Google Tensor is the first custom-built processor designed by Google and made specifically forthe Pixel.This is one powerful chip.This means better, more advanced AI, superb computational photography, better power efficiency,and a faster performance.It’s important to keep Google Tensor in mind as we run through the Pixel 6 Pro camerafeatures, because there are some seriously crazy things you can do on this baby.And just so you know, every single image and video you’ll see today has not had any editingto it or touch-ups or any settings changed prior or after snapping the shots.I want you to get the feel of the quality of the camera on the 6 Pro if you were tojust take her right out of the box and start snapping pics.Because here’s what Google does really well.What you see is what you get.What’s featured in their launch events, is what you get.There are no gimmicks.You don’t have to understand any special settings and you don’t have to be a professionalphotographer in order to snap professional-level photos with Pixel 6 Pro.Amen!But now onto features and first on our features list, let’s talk about ultrawide selfies.Next level selfie, unlocked.I mentioned earlier the improvements to the front-facing camera, but now, not only isthe camera quality better, but you can zoom out on your selfie and get way more peoplein the shot, without losing image quality.So here’s a little screen recording of me zooming out on the selfie, so you can seea considerable difference.And then this is the final shot - an ultrawide selfie for the ages.Now I want to move on to Portrait Mode for a moment.And I know what you’re thinking.Tasia, that’s not new to Pixel 6 Pro.And you’d be right, it’s not.But, remember, Google Tensor our all-new processor.I’m telling you, portrait mode has gotten major improvements.So we all know about portrait mode and how it’s a great way to make a smartphone photolook more like a professional photograph by adding blur to the background and enhancingthe subject.But, let’s take a look at a portrait shot from Pixel 5A for a moment.If you all remember that video I did, I really nitpicked on some of the edging of the portraitphotos.I thought it could be a little crisper.Well, now take a look at some portrait mode shots on Pixel 6 Pro.So, let’s start with this one I took inside.And no, I’m not trying to give you model face, but I want to show you the detail aroundthe edging of my face.It perfectly edged my nose and chin - it looks so good.It also edged my hair perfectly too.And it can be hard to do that with wavy or curly hair.Just incredible.And again, can we talk about the quality of these photos?Like the detail MY GOD.It’s almost too good.Like, do you remember when we went from SD to HD on TV and everyone freaked out.Then from HD to 4K and it was like woah pores!Well, that’s how I feel with Pixel 6 Pro camera - it’s like so clear.Like shockingly clear.As in, is that what I look like?Ah!But, back to the features.Portrait mode still has all the additional editing capabilities you’ll love like portraitblur and portrait light.Which, if you want to know how to use those features in-depth, check out the video I didon the Pixel 5a.Now, portrait mode coupled with the next feature makes the camera a real stand-out.And that’s real tone.Historically, image tech was calibrated for white skin, which is clearly not accuratefor everybody.With real tone, over 15 times more portraits of people of color were added to the coreHDR + database that informs Pixel camera tuning.So, this means major improvements on the auto-white balance and auto-exposure.Real tone really allows for more richness, detail and true to color images.There’s also better face detection in the camera and get this, it’ll work with Snapchatand other third-party camera apps.Okay moving onto another new Pixel 6 Pro camera feature: Super Res Zoom. ohhh, if you thoughtthe zoom quality on Pixel couldn’t get any better.HA!You ain’t seen nothing yet.Pixel 6 Pro includes a telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom.Which, if you take a look at, what else, my dog Poppie, here she is with no zoom, thenwe’ll bump up to 2x zoom which is still incredibly sharp.Now, let’s take a look at 4x zoom, okay wow.The details on her collar, her fur, it is so crisp.But that’s not good enough, let’s ramp this up to 20x zoom.Super res style on steroids.Surely, things are going to get squirrely… but no!She moved her head towards me right as I snapped and holy moly tyler toffoli look at thesedetails.You can even see her eye gunk in disturbing detail.You guys, this is 20x zoom.Truly incredible.Just super detailed, sharp quality.I can’t wait to take my gorg little Pixel 6 Pro to a hockey game or concert and usethe telephoto lens.And with super res zoom, you’ll be able to capture better night sight details too.Which, if you remember from Pixel 5a, night sight was already so good, it’s hard toimagine it getting even better.But it is!It’s just so good!Alright, I’m going to be honest with you, the next 3 features are probably my favorites,if I had to choose favorites, they kind of blow my mind.So, first, let’s talk about face unblur.This does exactly what you’d expect, without you having to do a thing.Google Pixel 6 Pro uses Tensors machine learning to unblur faces in low light or with too muchmovement.So here’s how this works.The Pixels sensors are scanning the scene for faces before you even take the photo.That way, if a face is blurry it gears up a second camera to get ready to snap a shottoo.So, when you snap the photo, it takes two images simultaneously - one from the ultrawide camera and one from the main camera.The ultra wide camera is using a faster exposure to minimize blur.Then, Google’s machine learning fuses the sharper face from the ultra wide with thelow-noise shot from the main camera and voila!Even in a photo where I’m jumping, my face is completely sharp and unblurred.And if that wasn’t good enough, it’ll analyze the photo again for any other blurredbits and adjust as necessary.So, really take in this photo.I was jumping up and down here.Look at not just my face, but my hands, my hair that was clearly moving about - it’sall so clear.What EVEN!This is unreal.And as if the camera on Pixel 6 Pro couldn’t get any better, the Google Gods created MotionMode.This is perfect for action shots.So for those times when you want a blur - like in a background that has motion or movement,just like with face unblur, the pixel camera takes multiple photos at the same time andcombines them using computational photography and once again machine learning.This allows the pixel to identify the subject of the photo, figure out what’s moving,and then add aesthetic blur to the photo.So there are two motion modes: the action pan mode where it’ll focus on a moving subjectand then long exposure that adds blur to moving objects in the scene.So, here’s a photo of my husband jogging along the canal and it seems normal, but withmotion mode on, you can toggle between the regular nonfancy photo and the action panshot of motion mode.Would ya look at that?It’s added a blur to the background but kept him crisp.Now, I will say, this action mode takes some getting used to because you have to followthe subject a bit.And the faster the subject is moving, the harder it is to grab a crisp shot.Here’s what I mean.I attempted to take about 4 shots of Poppie running after the ball, but she runs at ascientific speed of fast as all heck and I literally could not get her in the frame properly.So, this was the best shot I got of her heading towards me and you can see the action panmode struggled a bit here.But this is me really nitpicking a very cool feature.Because it really excels with long exposure.Particularly, with nature photography.So since Google used an image of a waterfall to showcase motion mode at the Pixel launchevent, I decided to test that out myself.So I headed to Arizona falls and snapped some pics.Okay, it’s not like a world wonder, but it produces hydropower here in the desert.So Pixel snapped multiple photos and analyzed them for movement in order to give a blurredeffect on the waterfall.How awesome is this?So here is without motion mode and here is with motion mode.Then I jumped in the photo to see how it would do and here’s without motion mode and thedifference of the waterfall with motion mode.Look at how it has softened the water to give it that movement, while I’m nice and crisp.So then I just kept taking motion mode photos because, well, why not?I feel like I keep saying this but it’s just incredible.You no longer have to be a pro photographer to achieve this effect.You just need a Pixel 6 Pro.Straight outta the box.That’s it.But now moving on to what I think might be the biggest game-changer yet.Magic eraser.Oh, ya’ll, there are no words.So, I’m just going to show you the awesomeness.In google photos, simply select a photo and tap on edit.Then, scroll to tools.Here, you’ll now have a magic eraser option.Simply tap on that and if there are obvious distractions, you’ll have suggestions forthose in your photo so you will have the option to erase all at once, or tap to remove oneby one.And if you don’t have suggestions, you can still remove whatever you want.Simple circle it or draw a line over the distraction to make it disappear.I’ve done this on a bunch of photos and it’s amazing.Now, even Google admits, it’s not perfect yet, but you guys its sooooo good!So, here, at the AZ falls I don’t want the shadow of the phone on the ground here soI’ll just swipe on it, and boom, Google erases it for me.And it does a really good job too, you can’t even tell the shadow was there.So now, let’s move on to another photo.Say there are a lot of little distractions and you want to be more precise, you can zoomin on the photo to get into the nitty-gritty details.So, here, we’ve got a few things that I can take out of this photo.First, I want to take out this umbrella from the background, so boom, it’s gone and youcan’t really tell it was ever there.Now I’ll zoom back out and as you can see Poppie photo-bombed this picture of me.So, sorry, girl, you got to go.And just like that she’s gone.Now you can see here, if you look closely, I’ve lost the grout lines on the tile, sothat could be an indication an edit was made - if someone is looking super close.But here’s the thing, I’ve tried a bunch of those paid apps that claim you can justuse your finger to swipe away anything from a photo and leave it perfect.Let me tell you - those apps don’t work.You can ALWAYS tell items have been removed.It’s obvious and pretty bad.But with Google Pixel magic eraser, the quality is light years ahead.And, that’s not all.Oh no, there’s more!You can use magic eraser on all your photos!Whether you took them just now or years ago.WHATTTTT!!!So, here, this is a picture I took on Pixel 5a - so before the 6 Pro was even out.But look, on Pixel 6 Pro, I can still use magic eraser.And ya, I’m removing Poppie’s poop from the photo okay?Don’t judge me!But is this mind blowing or what?And guess what?It doesn’t just work on old photos shot on Pixel devices.IT WORKS ON ALL YOUR PHOTOS.YES, I SWEAR!RUN, DON’T WALK, GET PIXEL 6 PRO IMMEDIATELY.So, here is a photo that was taken by a professional photographer with a professional camera andyet, I still have the ability to use magic eraser.So, let’s get rid of that light in the background.And voila, just like that, she gone.MIND.BLOWN.(boom) And this is just the beginning when it comes to editing capabilities.Truly, Pixel 6 Pro just became a threat to Photoshop.Ya, I said it.So, couple magic eraser with the ability to manually white balance your photos and videosright from the camera app, and this device is truly, a what?A game-changer.So now when you go to take a photo or video, tap on the screen and you’ll notice thenew white balance option on the left.Simply use the slider to adjust the balance to more cool or warm tones.I just want to buy a Pixel 6 Pro for everyone I know and just say here.Here it is.This is your new camera, this is your new photo editing tool.Throw your other phone away.Thank me later.Because remember, these features are added bonuses on top of all the other amazing photoediting features available since the Pixel 5a.Which, if you want a refresher on all those features, you can check out the 5a video hereor via the link in the description below.And, as if things couldn’t get any better.It’s a double header this week, because I’m dropping another video on launch day- MY BIRTHDAY - October 28th, with the best Google Pixel 6 Pro features outside of allthese amazing camera features.So be sure to check that out.Also can we talk about Google making Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro release date on my birthday?It’s like they just are really my true life companion.So now for my final verdict.Do I think Pixel 6 Pro is the most advanced camera system in the world, as Google claims?Yes.Do I think this is the best smartphone camera available?Yes.Let us check the record to back up these claims.Again, I need to go back to the clarity and crispness of the photos.With literally just pointing and shooting, the images produced are stunning.Whether using the front-facing camera, on portrait mode, using the ultra-wide lens,or super zoom, the images are so impressive.Couple all of that with real tone, motion mode and face unblur, and I really don’tsee how this camera can be beat.And then there’s manual auto-white balancing and magic eraser?COME ON, PEOPLE.And if you remember from the beginning of this video - all the examples you saw werenot edited at all.I didn’t change any settings prior to shooting anything and I didn’t touch anything after.It’s just too good.The 5a became my go-to camera after getting it, and I’m now declaring it: Pixel 6 Prois my new go-to camera.She and I are going to have the most wonderful life together.Now there are a lot of other features I didn’t even touch on in this video.They were cut for time!We’ve all only got so many hours in the day.So, remember to head to the google store link below to get all the specs and features ofPixel 6 Pro.What do you think of the Google Pixel 6 Pro camera?Are you as blown away as I am?Let everyone know in the comments below.As always, thank you so much for watching, if you liked this video, I want to know sogive it a like, a share, or leave that comment below.You can click right about here to subscribe to my channel and right about here and herefor even more Pixel content.Thanks for watching and I just have one last question: Google, will you marry me?"

d3EfFBRAYQQ,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,the pixel 6 pro many reviewers onlinewill talk about software and to behonest that is what google is good atbut only a few reviewers will talk abouthow phones are built and what they'remade of that's where i come intoday we'll be assessing the durabilityand structural integrity of the pixel 6pro google's latest flagship smartphoneshould be interestinglet's get started[Music][Applause][Music]right off the bat the biggest visualdistinction between this and othersmartphones is the massive geordi esquestar trek style visor on the back with ahuge old protrusion lengthwise acrossthe entire surface for americans theraised lip is a little thicker than aquarterabout the same thickness as an sd cardor very similar in thickness to a strandof spaghettifor everyone else in the world it's twoand a half millimetersi've mentioned previously that i feellike smartphones internally are mostlythe same these days and that remainstrue for the pixel 6 pro as well with afew caveats google software is whatmakes this phone different it's livecaptions live transcribe and livelanguage translation features aremind-bogglingly good plus you know howyou feel like your phone's alwayslistening and giving ads for stuff youonly mention verbally to friends wellnow google has managed to turn thatcreepiness into a marketing bullet pointwith something called now playing whichturns on your phone's microphones allday and identifies songs for you thatare playing nearby who needs conspiracytheories when reality is right hereenough with the software though let'sget back to the hardwarethe nice thing about the camera bridgeacross the whole back panel is thatthere is zero rocking when it's laidflati like that plastic is level two orthree glass has a five or six andsapphire is a level eight or ninethe pixel 6 pro starts seeing scratchesat a level six with deeper grooves at alevel sevengoogle is using gorilla glass invictusfor the display which means that the11.1 megapixel front-facing hole punchcamera is also protected from scratchesthe earpiece lit up top is super thinwithout any grills to fall out or getdirty if you remember last year thepixel 5 was made with some strangeplastic coated metal stuff but this yearwe get solid metal at least on this sidewe have metal volume rockers and a metalpower buttonsurprisingly though the top edge of thephone is 100 plasticacross the entire edgethis is something we've never seenbefore usually all the sides on asmartphone are made from the samematerial i imagine that this plasticmight have something to do with the 5gantenna location but we won't know forsure until we take it apart along theleft side google switches back to metalincluding the ip67 sim card tray whichhas room for a single sim card noexpandable memorythe bottom edge of the phone is alsoback to metalwith its usbc port and pretty big slotsfor the loudspeaker and lower microphonethree of the four sides are made frommetal

are all protected under alayer of glassthe sides of the camera hump though aremade with a scratchable plasticfun fact did you know that there are 1million billion ants alive on earthright now i'm not sure whose job it isto count them all nobody mentioned antcounting during career day at my highschool but that is a lot of antsthe pixel 6 pro has a 6.7 inch 1440p 120hertz displayand some phones survive the burn testwith no damage but the pixels pixels onthe pixel 6 pro go lava red and thenblack after only about 15 secondsand stay that way which just solidifieseven further my resounding agreementthat the burn test remainsinconsequential we'll keep doing itthough just to make surebefore the bin test our pixel 6 pro doeshave an under screen optical fingerprintreader it's rather quick on the setupand once my fingerprint is registeredwe can add some spaghetti i mean level 7deeper grooves and see if the scannercan still read my fingerprint throughthe heavily scratched glassit got things right the majority of thetime even with the damage which is goodunder screen fingerprint readers thoughare still just not my favoriteone thing i am nervous about though isthe large camera bump that's basicallyseparating the phone into two halves itmight make the perfect creasing pointfor the phone to just snap in halfduring the bin test starting the binfrom the back though we do get thesmallest of flexes and flipping aroundto the front we get basically the sameresultthe pixel 6 pro doesn't seem verystructurally affected by that largecross panel camera bump the build issolid with no cracks bins or kinks itdid get burned easier than mostsmartphones and has the weird plasticrail up top but other than that i'd saythe pixel 6 pro is a solid phone andpasses my durability testas a fun little bonus here's a sneakpeek of the insides with my tear downskin from dbrand there are a lot of goodlooking phones internally this yearplus with a grip case it flushes out thesurface of that

tC92lOEA0t4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,so at long last after leaks andpre-announcements and announcements andbillboards and tv ads i guess we're atthe final moment the launch of the pixel6 and the pixel 6 proand i got themright herein my handscan you even stink and believe itif you've been following pixel phonesfor a while then you might know thateven the best ones they haven't beenamong the best smartphone flagships andthese phones they're supposed to changeall that so let's start with theimportant numbers herepricing 5.99 for the pixel 6 8.99 forthe pixel 6 pro and that's with 128 gigsof storage too so they're a little lessexpensive than comparable iphonessamsung's or even oneplus phones whichis a bit of a pixel theme that continueseven though these are meant to behigh-end phones now this is a hands-onand the rules of the hands-on are that ican tell you about the hardware and ican show you my home screen butthat's about it that could be a bad signbut i think that google is going forthat whole like live tech event hands-onthinganyway those are the rules that they setfor everybody solet's talk about hardware and with thata little asmr of these very clickybuttons[Music]buttons are importantnow despite the price differences thesetwo phones they actually share a lot soboth phones they have google's newcustom tensor processor and google saysit's competitive with qualcommsnapdragon 888 that's a big deal andit's all centered around google's aiboosting tpu that promises to improvephotos and videos text-to-speech searchthe list goes on we'll really have tosee how that goes in in our full reviewand when we're really testing thesephones so stay tuned for our full reviewcoming very soonboth pixels also have a 50 megapixelmain camera that uses pixel binning tocombine four pixels into one to make a12.5 that's 50 divided by four 12.5megapixel image and that sensoryo that sensor is huge one over1.31 inchesand that's bigger than the iphone 13pro's main sensor if you're keeping townbut the pixel pitch is slightly smallerat 1.2 micronsand then the main lens it has an f 1.85aperture both have a 12 megapixelultrawide at f 2.2 both have fixed focushole punch selfie cameras on the frontboth have stereo speakers both cancapture 4k video at up to 60 frames persecond and slo-mo at 240 1080. they alsoshare the same google software it's aversion of android 12 that got a fewextra google specific things that arepowered by that tensor ai processorincluding faster translations and amagic eraser feature that lets you getrid of unwanted stuff in the backgroundof photos i'm actually like prettyexcited to test that one out and a fewother things they also have opticalfingerprint sensors under the screenwireless charging and reverse wirelesscharging for accessories like the pixelbuds i love that feature so much andgoogle's calling it battery share nowboth also support wi-fi 6e bluetooth 5.2and nfc they have five years of promisedupdate supports which is the longestgoogle has ever offered a pixel andlonger than basically any other androidphone you can buy and google is going tobe selling plastic clip-on cases thatwork around the camera bumps and addsome grip but they don't feel nearly asnice as those old fabric cases thatpixel phones havethough they might age a bit better thanthose did which aged incredibly poorlybut anyway they lastly also share adesign sensibility so that's gorillaglass victus on the front and two-toneglass on the backbut let's talk about this camera barit's a very a la galaxy s10 if you askme but likeon steroidsall camera bumps are silly and i thinkwe've just gotten used to like seeingthem over here so i'm not really toobothered by this the only thing is thatit's absolutely massive i think thebenefit though is that since it spansthe whole back of the phone it meansthat your phone will sit on a table alot more evenly i also think i would getlike really used to this camera bumpbecause if i own this it would always bein a case which would kind of likefill in the gap between the bump and theback of the phone but i also think theway that this is executed shows thateven though this is google's 6 pixel itkind of feels like it's first or secondtry making a true flagship for examplethe curves from the sides they don'teven blend in with the camera bump whichis weird and in general while fit andfinish are good there are just a fewplaces where it seems like things aren'ttruly seamlesslike you can literally feel the seamsespecially on the regular pixel sixwhich hold on hold on hold on full stopdieter thinks we should be calling itthe pick six and the pick six proi'm not completely sold on this i can'tsay that i love it so uh comment downbelow okay so let's now talk about thedifferences between these phones whatdoes an extra 300actually get you well the pro has aslightly bigger screen with a higherrefresh rate more ram up to 512gigabytes of storage and the screen iscurved on the edges the bezel'sinvisible on the sides and smaller onthe topcurved screens have really fallen out offashion lately which is a huge bummer tome because i'm a huge curved screen fanwhich i think is part of the reason ihaven't upgraded from the s10 but anywayhere i have to say that you can see ashadow on the edges when you're lookingat it at an angle and we have to spendmore time with these to see if there'sany palm resting issues or you knowtouch sensitivity issues on on the edgeof the screen as well so stay tuned forour review for for more on that the proalso has a 4x folded telephoto zoom it'sright here it's in the middle of the barit looks pretty badass and the regulardoesn't and the pros selfie camera is alittle higher resolution it's a littlebit bigger in size and it has a littlewider field of view as well now the prohas millimeter wave 5g the regular doesnot except on verizon where it will costyou 100 more the 6 pro also has a ultrawide band chip and the pro is shinierlike shiny edges unlike the matte edgeson the regular and lastly the pro comesin more professional color options ithink the regular colors are a littlebit more fun and honestly this likewhite and green is so dope now this is aquestion for the review but you know i'mnot entirely convinced that the pro isworth the extra moneya lot of that is going to depend on howwell the telephoto camera performs andthat slightly larger batteryand side note this phone does support 30watt fast charging but it does not comewith a brick in a box sohopefully you have your own by nowoverall these do feel like differentpixels than what we've seen in the pastthey aren't the mid-range pixel 5 thatwe got last year and they don't reallylook like the pixel 4 either but at thesame time there's just something kind ofgeneric about these designs i don't knowthey feel very samsung-esque orsomething we might get from tcl or oppofor that matter they're also bothlarge like the regular pixel is nearlyas big as the pro for someone who hassmall hands and small pockets you allbetter be pouring one out for me thesethings are more like the iphone 13 promax size than anything else and googleis not giving us a small and largechoice like it did in the pastjust give me small phones pleaseplease all right so that's the pixel 6and the pixel 6 pro we're going to beputting these to the test over the nextfew days we're pushing their performancewe're testing their battery life and i'mtaking so many photos and videos so letus know if you have any questions downbelow and uh pick six pick six pro pixelsix pixel six pro team becker or teamdieter on that onealso buds dieter got to sit down withgoogle ceo sundar bachai and thehardware chief rick osterlo last weekand he talked to them on the verge castpodcast which is up right now so you'llwant to listen to that to helpunderstand a little bit more about thesephones than just reading off their specsand showing the hardware all rightthat's all we'll see you soon buds
5Bn0AMVD3s0,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,(music playing)
UsD87v8F914,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,[Music]hey what's up mkbhd here and this isgoogle's new budget phone the pixel 6awe knew this was coming i've had myhands on this phone for a little over aweek now and i have my thoughts sort ofsummarized into one major thought whichisthere's a lot of competition in thisbudget phone space nowand this phoneisn't the obvious hands-down winner thatit might have once been but this yearmore than everi think the primary reason for thatcomes down to the displayand i'll explain what i mean so whatwe're getting with this google budgetphone is and this may sound familiar anew chip the exact same one that's inthe flagship models the same softwareexperience as the flagships but justwith some cheaper hardware surroundingit you know kind of like the iphone sebut google's version and so the pricehere is 449 dollarsit really looks just like any other ofthe pixel 6 phones i mean that's the onething i like about the whole lineupthey're unmistakably pixel you've gotthe two-tone colors the camera baracross the middle is recognizable as apixel from a mile away the onlydifference here is well it's a slightlynew color this one is a sage greenbut also the camera bump isn't as tallso it's a bit slimmer it doesn'tprotrude out of the phone as much so idon't really use the ledge as a grip asmuch anymore as i used to on the otherphones everything else though on theoutside is pretty much the same it's gotthe aluminum rails same power and volumebuttons on the right side with a notchbetween themthe speakers and the slightly off centerusb c port at the bottomit's all back on the inside though thisphone is ip67 not ip68 and there is nowireless chargingthat to me was kind of a bummer i knowwe're probably saving a couple dollarshere but this phone still has a glassback andi don't know if you've used wirelesscharging before then it's kind of worthnoting that this one won't have it andthen also the pixel 5a had a headphonejack this pixel 6adoes not have a headphone jack so againif you use that then that's anotherthing to note but really around thefront here is where the pixel 6aactually most reflects its price sowe've got a 6.1 inch flat 1080p oleddisplay at 60 hertz with a top centerhole punch and an in-display fingerprintreadervisually it's an okay display it'sdecently sharp with good color and itgets bright enough to support hdr andnot totally suck outdoors but also ithas some pretty serious off-axisrainbowing and the auto brightness is alittle finickyand the fingerprint reader is definitelyslow it's on the slow side just like itwas on the pixel 6 and 6 pro now thismay be forgivable stuff in a budgetphone we've seen stuff like that aroundthis price but what really takes it atear down for me is the 60 hertzspecifically becausethis onefeels slow actually let me be morespecific sothis is a 60hz display there's lots ofother 60hz displays in phones out therehaving a tensor chip which is arelatively high-end chip inside shouldmean that the phone still feels fast andit still opens apps pretty fast andthat's still mostly true herebut for whatever reason theresponsiveness and the actual smoothnessof the display this is not smooth so ithink this is absolutely going to be oneof those things that you either feel andnotice right away or you just nevernotice i think there's a lot of peoplewho are going to be looking to get apixel 6a that are coming from an olderphone coming from a budget phone comingfrom other 60 hertz phones and this willprobably feel right in line but evenamongst these 60 hertz phones i feellike this is one of the choppiest onesand now i've also recently come from aworld of 120 hertz and 165hz flagshipphones and gaming phones and that's notthe normal place a 6a buyer will comefrom but the second you experience 120hzon a phone you are way more likely tonotice the dropped frames in animationsall the time even at 60hz literally justscrolling around pulling down thenotification shade opening and closingapps normal stuff is just constantlyslightly choppy now the funny thing isit's hard for me to show you this stuffon camera this is a 30 fps video andthese things are happening somewherebetween 30 and 60 fps but yeah this isone of those things where i bet if youget to see a 6a in a store or try it outthen you'll feel what i'm talking aboutbut it really is a feel thing and thisis purely coming from my decade of phonetesting experience this one feels choppynow depending on who you are even all ofthis might be acceptable knowing stillthat things are technically launchingquickly and you're not lagging out andyou're actually launching apps at normalspeedbut i'm combining all this with myknowledge of what i've just seen happenwith the last year of pixels which isthey haven't aged particularlygracefully so i've seen what happened tosix and the six proand i worry about how this fun will ageconsidering how it feels now isguaranteed three years of softwareupdates but what does this phone looklike in three years now the good thingis everything else about the pixel hereis exactly what you'd expect the samesoftware experience as the big brotherswith material u google's widgets anddynamic colors and stock apps like thecalculator and settings and camera etcetera google's smartest features areall here like assistant call screeningis awesome live translate and thesorcery that is basically instant speechto text everywhere in this phone thanksto the tensor chip they're all so goodthe haptics are also pretty good whichis great to see in a budget phone alongwith the stereo speakers here really theonly variables that could have come upas a surprise potentially would bebattery or cameras so pixel 6a's batteryis about 4 400 milliamp hoursand it turned out to be fine there weresome concerns because oh it's a tensorchip it's a higher end chip uses morepower maybe in a smaller phone that'sbad butturns out 60 hertz kind of balances thatout so i had pretty good battery life iwas just mildly annoyed by not havingwireless charging but then there's thecameras so with the camera unlike theprevious pixels this does not share thesame cameras as the more expensivebrothers the 6 and the 6 pro instead ithas a downgraded 12 megapixel camerasetup for both the standard and theultra wide which might lookdisappointing on paper butthis is the old sony imx 363 sensorwhich some of you nerds will alreadyrecognize is the same exact sensor thatwas in the pixel 5 and the same that wasin the pixel 4 and the pixel 3 and thepixel 2 in other words this is an oldersmaller low resolution sensor but it isalso absolutely a tried-and-true greatsmartphone camera because of google'scomputational photography chops so ireally appreciated that even with thelower number you know with the tensorchip processing things happening reallyfast the shots that come out of thiscamera are crisp contrasty and confidentjust like they were with the olderpixels the colors are on point too nottoo much over processing happening andthere is not too much fringing at theedges either with close-up subjects andthe dynamic range and how it handleshighlights is a plusso i mean it's easy to see why theystuck with this for so long and the factis this is still easily a top two budgetsmartphone camera easy it also has theultra wide that the iphone se doesn'thave and it takes decent looking 4kvideos up to 60fpsthese cameras are like pizza surethey're not super new and groundbreakingthere's nothing that would impress youabout them on paper but they get the jobdone in a design that you can dress uplike a ninja turtle if you get the rightdbrand skinsyou know the ones linked in thedescription the conversation around thepixel 6a is probably the mostinteresting when you consider thecompetitors just the other phones thatyou could get for 450 and there's someother really good onesso to make it easy i think you shouldget the pixel 6a if you valuethe google software experiencethose featuresand or the cameraway over everything else but if that'snot you you could get a samsung galaxya53 for a hundred bucks less and that'sgoing to have 120hz display that hasexpandable storage or you could get anothing phone which i just reviewedwhich has all those quirky lightsfeatures on the back but that's also gota much biggermuch much smoother 120hz display and alltheir featuresyou could even get an iphone se if youwanted to which yes is gonna bea 60 hertz single camera setup with asmaller battery but that's also aflagship chipset that's also wirelesscharging and that's also let's be realit's an iphone which is enough of afeature for some people and then there'ssome nord phones and some pocophones andsome moto g's all with their own meritsso yeah pixel 6a turns out is really allabout the google software experienceand the camera for the price that'swhere it excels but yeah if you'reshopping around keep your eyes openbecause there's a bunch of good stuffand whilegood phones aren't getting cheapcheap phones are still very much gettinggoodthere you have it that's been it thanksfor watchingcatch you guys in the next

KaG9_AEhKos,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"Hey, everyone.So thisright here is a pretty special product that I think you're all going to love.This is the newest flagship smartphone from Google, the Google Pixel sixand huge shout out to Google for sending me this phone for us to check out.And let's go ahead and unbox it.So let'scheck out what you get inside the box when you pick up your own pixel 6.The unboxing is pretty straightforward.With the pixel 6 series, you just remove these two tabsat the bottom of the box and inside you're greeted with the phone itself,some documentations and a USB-c cable for charging so let's jump right inand talk about its specs real quick.The Google Pixel 6 is rocking, of course, Google's first ever SOC on a smartphonecalled Google Tensor.It also packs 8 gigs of Ram, 128 gigs or 256 gigs of storage,a 50 megapixel wide camera, a 12 megapixelultra wide camera, as well as a 6.4 inch full HD plus oLED display.That just looks really beautiful to look at.Now, the display itself features a 90 Hertz refresh rate,which gives you the smooth scrolling effect.If you've never used a devicewith a high refresh rate before, this is definitelygoing to be a nice change of pace for you.You'll notice that navigating throughout the OS or switching between appsor scrolling on social media that things are a lot smoother.You'll also noticehow rich and vibrant these colors are and how deep those blacks are as well.Thanks to that old panel that the Pixel six is using.Now, one last thing that I do haveto point out about this displayis that Google opted in for a flat display for the pixel 6 which I'm a big fan of.I can't stress enoughhow nice it is to have a flat display in a modern flagship nowadays.In my opinion, it'sjust so much better to use on a daily basis in terms of its overall design.I absolutely love it.It's so refreshing to see this new style from Google, and I think that the pixelhas this distinct look to it now.It's unique, it's cool, and you can tell from any anglewhen you look at the back of the phone that it's the new pixel6 going away with the squared off camera module from previous pixel phones.We now have this long black camera bar that runs across a devicewhich houses the two cameras, microphone and the flash.The pixel 6 comes in three different colors, stormy black sort of seafoamand kind of coral.All three colors have this two tone colored look.It's a lot more noticeable on the sort of seafoamand kind of coral color way with the top part of the phone being more saturated,whereas the bottom portion below the camera bar is a more toned down look.Overall, though, build quality.It's a solid piece of slab that feels great to hold.And in my opinion, the best size for any smartphone currentlyAll right.Now let's talk about the new processor on the pixel 6 Google tensor,Google tensor, like I mentioned in the beginning, is the first SOCthat Google developed for its smartphone, which uses two high performance corestwo mid cores and four high efficiency cores in translation,Google tensoris about 80% faster than the pixel 5 and after weeks of using the pixel 6as my go to device, Google Tensor in my opinion, performed really well.No matter what I did, I didn't notice any slowdowns or drop frames.Even when I'm playing games, switching between appsor just scrolling through websites or articles were all really smooth too.Now, given that this is a completely new processor,a lot of apps may not be fully optimized for a Google tensor yet.So performance on some apps may not be the best as of right now, butgive it a few months or so and everything should be running smooth like butter.Battery life is super important in any modern smartphone,and the pixel 6 is equipped with a 4614 mahpower battery, which to be quite honest, lasts almost an entire day for me.Paired with a 90 Hertz refresh rate and full HD plus oled display battery lifeon the pixel 6, in my opinion, is so much better than most smartphonesthat I've tried recently.Now everyone's use case is obviously going to be different, so my day to dayin how I use my pixel 6 is going to be completely different than yours.I'm usually on social media apps and constantly checking and writingemails and occasionally playing games when I have some downtime.But I also watch a ton of YouTube videos on the go to.On average, I get about five and a half hoursof screen on time, which is good enough for me.And even if I did need to charge up, I can always plug in the phone via USB Cpaired with a 30 wattcharging brick and get up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes.So it's not really a big deal whether or not it lasts an entire day.I usually leave my phone charging overnightusing a wireless charger anyways, so battery life is never an issue for me.Now, last but not least, the camera's.This is what Google pixel phones are all about.It's about the camerasand how it can take incredible photos no matter the lighting conditions.I've always love how pixel phones and processorphotos compare to other Android smartphones.So the pixel 6 features two cameras on the back,a 50 megapixel wide camera and a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera.And up frontyou have an eight megapixel camera, which, to be honest, isn't my favorite.But let's talk more about the camera quality and my new favorite feature.Now, the overall photo quality on the pixel6 hasn't really changed much from previous pixel smartphones.It still shoots, in my opinion, the best photos from any smartphone.The shots are clear, not overly saturated, and the colors look super accurate,which I'm sure you'll appreciate as well.Low light or nighttime photography looks incredible as well.I personally feel that there's less noise on the new pixel 6 versus previouspixel phones, and the colors look more true to life as well.One thing I really want to highlight with a pixel 6 is magic eraserI think this feature alone is such a game changerwhen it comes to smartphone photography.What Magic Eraser allows you to do is get rid of unwanted objectsor people in your shot.So let's say there's someone in the background of your photoor there's a bunch of small things that you don't want in your photo.What you can do on a pixel 6 is edit your photo.Look for Magic eraser in Google photos, trace around that personor object and bam they're gone easy as that.And the best part is you don't even need to be connected to Wi-Fior have a data connection to use this feature.Pretty impressive, right?And that's it.That's the Google Pixel 6 in a nutshell.For an insanely good price of just 599, you're getting a flagshipsmartphone with a beautiful looking design.Great set of cameras and the reliability of stock Androidwith future software updates.Now, sure, there's a ton of competition out there for the pixel 6but you can't beat the hardwareand software optimization from Google with this pixel six anyways.That's going to do it for me.I hope you all enjoy this quick little video about the Google Pixel 6and let me know in the comments section down belowif you're picking one up and if so, what color.Anyways, I'm Mark Linsanganat HeyMarkL on social and I hope to catch you all in the next one."
PXJ6vuTSQkU,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,this video is sponsored by spigen we'vegot the iphone 13 pro max s22 ultra andthe pixel 6 pro i think it's alwaystricky to compare these devices becausethey are good in their own waybut that's what i'm going to do for youtoday and before we do that i think it'sworth calming down a little bit whilstmany people out there will try to tellyou that one is better than the otheri don't fully agree with that i wouldsay though that there are features ineach of these phones that differentiatethem features that make them better thanthe others and you already know thatright these are not brand new phonesthey've been around for a while but inactually using all of these devices notat once of course but trying to reallyfit them into my workflow of running atech consultancy business during the dayand being a content creator as well idid find some answers that hopefully youwill find interesting or at leastentertaining i'm alex and i do down toearth tech reviews if that's somethingthat you like welcome to the channel ingeneral you really can't go wrong withany of these flagship devices i know itsounds like i'm sitting on the fencehere and i don't want to upset peoplebut that's not it for a bit of context istill remember using a public phone tosend a message to someone's pager yeahi'm that old so to me these devices arenothing short of marvels of technologyin engineering i could even include afew more options here buti am run out of fundsoh also i am what you could call anapple fanboy and before you let me knowin the comments how biased i am towardsapple i couldn't really disagree withyou based on how many apple products iown if you cut me in half you probablyfind that i've got lightning cablesinstead of veins and my brain lasts upto 10 hours without recharging but thisversion of me get ready for this is nowover 1500 times faster than last year'sin many ways that's trueanyway i have been genuinely more andmore impressed by android productsrecently apple phones out there willprobably hate me for this but it's truei do feel that non-apple devices havemore freedom to innovate and bringthings to their smartphones that applewill take two to three years sometimeseven longerand they will rename it and call itsomething something really cool andwe'll all go wow brilliant applebut you and i know they're they're notfooling us right the amount of freedomwe get on android phones and some of theintelligence features that we get aswell on these devices are kind ofsurpassing the iphone in some areas forme but the iphone to me especially inthe pro range still represents topquality and a smooth user experiencemore specifically how the iphone workswith other devices from apple that youmight have like an apple watcha homepod mini or whatever it might be alaptop or an ipad aka the ecosystem somemay call it the apple prison becauseonce you're in it it's quite hard to getout and we really can't take that awayfrom them you know it is quite powerfulthe s22 ultra here has failed to impressme as much as the pixel 6 pro did anywayor even as much as the s21 ultra did butthere are three reasons for that one ihave the exynos version here which to medoes feel a bit choppy it's kind of ajittery experience even more so than thes21 ultra which also had the exynos chipso i don't know come on samsung justgive us a snapdragon please reason 2 isearly days and i actually smashed thescreen in the making of this video soi've had less time with the s22 ultrathan i've had with the pixel 6 pro andthe iphone of course and the thirdreason well before i talk about thatit's probably a relevant time to showyou these amazing cases from today'ssponsor spigen which would haveprevented this from happening they havecases for the iphone the s22 ultra andthe pixel 6 prospeaking cases are super stylish andthey actually have a couple of newoptions as well for the s22 ultra thati'm really excited to share with youthey always come up with products thatoffer great functionality as well asprotecting your phone of course and amodel to suit your style for the s22voucher they have this new optic armorwhich i think is really cool has a coverfor the camera for that extra protectionaround the camera module that isbrilliant so if you're worried aboutscratching the camera module when youput this phone in here in a bag orwhatever it might be with coins or keysthis protection will really help in thatcase you know simply close this littlecover here which clicks nicely intoplace really well designed i always likewhen there's attention to detail thenyou can really see that here for the spen cut out it feels really well thoughtthrough lets you remove the s-penwithout any issues and this here isanother well-designed case this is thebrand new cryo armor case which isdesigned with gaming in mind and itlooks great on the s22 ultra the patternis really cool i love the kind oftexture of the back as well it has areally nice feel to it i like fidgetingwith my device so if that's you this isa perfect case for that but on the moretechnical side you know keeping thephone cooler actually helps conservingthe battery you know the battery healthso great to see that this is one of myfavorite cases this is the tough armorcase i think it's a beautiful protectivecase last time i reviewed this case iactually made a criticism about thevolume rockers here and how it was hardto figure out which one you're pressingi'm glad they fixed that now the powerbutton now has these grooves in it whichmakes it really tactile now thekickstand at the back is a nice touchtoo for me more cases should have thisoption for us it's perfect when watchingcontent and you're not near a stand orsomething to prop it up against andgreat protection too if you look insidethere's this extra layer of shockabsorbing material and all around thefront you get this really goodprotection as well you know there'senough clearance here so when you putthe phone down it's not going to scratchthe screen all of their cases workreally well with wireless chargers someof their cases actually have mac safesupport as well and this wirelesscharger from spigen is awesome too thisis a power r wireless charger and whenyou pair this with their arc stationwall charger you get this reallyexcellent solution for your desk verylow profile quite elegant as well reallynice and slim really well designed nicerubberized as well so it's not going toscratch your phone really good chargerspigen has thinner cases as well likethe liquid air case and like allspeaking cases it features spigen's ownair cushion technology on all corners ilove the texture of the back againreally quite sleek and makes it feelquite premium and this is the ultrahybrid model which is their clear casespigen use a very transparent kit as youcan see here is super transparent andtheir clear cases really stay clear fora long time in general i do like clearcases because you know kind of remindsme of the color of the device i boughtyou know i usually go for a specialcolor like you know this is the phantombrown this is sierra blue and of coursethe infamous red slash orange s22 ultraso it's nice that it preserves thatoriginal look of your phone right thethird reason the s22 ultra has notimpressed me so far anyway the samsungfans i'm sorry i have a sneaky suspicionthat the s22 ultra it's just not much ofan upgrade you know if you're comingfrom an s21 ultra i could be wrong hereof course but it just hasn't reallyimpressed me time will tell of coursebut i think we're talking it's a verylittle upgrade if you're coming from ans2100 there are some significantimprovements of course on the s22 ultrafor example if you care about thequality of portraits in video the s22ultra has really improved in those areaseven in the exynos version that i've gothere like it's it's definitelynoticeable other than that it feels likea minor upgrade i have to be honestalthough i haven't been using three orfour phones at the same time that'd besilly i have used them for entire daysat the time you knowwell the s22 ultra actually used it fornine months last year as my main phoneso i do have enough of an appreciationof what features work well on them andwhat features are kind of missing in theevenings though that's when i reach foran android device watching content andbrowsing social media i just think it'sbetter on android you know these devicesthat i've got herewhether the pixel or the samsung eithers21 or s22 ultra it sounds silly but ienjoy that the device is actuallycomfortable to hold especially you knowfor a longer period and even smallthings like the slightly differentaspect ratio on the pixel and samsungmake enough of a difference for me tonot want to pick the iphone in theevenings and pick these instead thedisplay on these devicesis incredible right but indoors there'sreally not a lot between them but thes22 ultramy gosh that's so bright and the colorsare incredible as you would expectsamsung always delivers on this placethe iphone doesn't allow for much of achange in colors it's mostly you knowtrue tone which is meant to adapt to theenvironment and the lighting and likemany things on the iphone it's reallyreally good but it doesn't really try togo beyond that with the pixel andsamsung you have a bit more control notso much on the pixel but the samsunghas a few more dials that you can youcan tune in when it comes to colorsettings in real life it only reallymatters when you're watching hdr contentright and that's true for all of thesephones so depending on the content thatyou're watching you know like hdrcontent the s22 ultra will be evenbrighter i'll do a proper displaycomparison like i did last year so eventhough samsung supplies this place toapple or at least some of the appleiphones or at least to some of theiphones it seems that they do keep theirbest displays for their own devices thes22 ultra is hitting over 1700 nits fora bit of a number comparison which idon't normally do here the iphone has athousand it's max brightness peaking at1200 nits for hdr so that's that's a bigdifference when it comes to the appsbetween android and ios apps there'sdefinitely an argument here which mostlycomes down to preferences but there'salso a point about the ecosystem but inmy experience most of the apps that icare about are absolutely fine onandroid i'm probably not a typical userhere because i've got multiple devicesand i'm constantly trying differentthings but i'd love to see more appshaving a central store for data orpurchase information a lot of them do tobe fair and you can have ios and androidapps working off of the same data butsome apps are not aware of each otherand in some cases you have to purchasethem again for android even if youalready have subscribed to the iosversion and vice versa it's a nicheproblem i know but it's a problemnonetheless from a performance point ofview i know there are some coolbenchmark numbers that we could run hereand prove that one device is better thanthe otheri'm not gonna do that what i will saythough is the s22 ultra despite it beingprobably the newest hereis visibly choppier than all of theother devices whether it's opening thecamera to take a photo making video oreven just scrolling in the home screensometimes you know you notice somejittering there and sometimes you haveto kind of try it again just to provethat you know am i seeing things herebut it's definitely there you do noticeit some people probably won't notice butwhen you compare that with other phoneslike the s21 ultra also exynos variantit does feel a bit slower i'm reallyhoping that this can be fixed withsoftware updates for the exynos i'llmake sure to keep you updated here i'llreport back on that one where i thinkthe android really comes alive is withthe intelligent features like you knowespecially the pixel 6 pro i coveredthis in a lot more detail in my pixelreview but that computationalphotography isamazing and their speech to textfeatures not just in english but in mynative language like portugueseincredible it'syou have to see to believe it it's justamazing the pixel is the first phonethat i can honestly say that can be usedas a true assistant in my scenarioanyway we take usability is that a wordease of use you know we take that forgranted sometimes the iphone is abeautiful machinepowerful delivers excellent results ineverything it does but there's a lot tobe said i think about the progress beingmade on android devices ultimately ithink it's great because you as aconsumer will be the real winnersee you soon[Music]you
6VXSeR2pUk0,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"Hey, everybody.Colin Smith here from PhotoshopCAFE.com And today we're doing a review on the Google Pixel6 Pro.We're going to put special emphasis on the camera and the computational photography andsome of the features.And of course, this was given to me from Google, but didn't have to do a review.And I don't have to say any particular things.I can say whatever I want.So this will be an honest review.And then I also have the case.And the case is called kind of semi transparent, so we can see the colors of the phone.So it comes in three different colors.It comes in black, white.And this one here, which is known as sort of sunny.So this has a gorilla glass Invictus on the front and back.So it's the strongest glass made by gorilla glass.One of the things that I really like about this is we're in the middle of a pandemic,so everyone's wearing a mask, so they're not doing face ID, but they're not putting a big,ugly fingerprint sensor either.What they have now is a thumbprint or fingerprint sensor on the front, which is just reallysmart.So I can actually do it through the glass to unlock the phone, and we can see it's anedge to edge screen with a curved screen on the very edges.We have a pinhole camera, so there's no notch on here.Beautiful screen.One of the things that just is very striking about this phone is the screen.It's a QHD, and it's beautiful.It's very vivid, and it almost looks like it's printed on there.It's so clean and vivid.The chip inside is the Google Tensor.So this is Google's first system on a chip that they actually make in house now.So they're making their own chip.So this gives them a lot more control over things, like what they want to do with theAI and the kind of features they want to build into their phone that they weren't able todo before.Now they're making their own hardware and their own chip.They can really unlock a lot of their AI and computational photography power.So it has a stainless steel rim that goes all the way around with the stainless steelbuttons.And, of course, the gorilla glass on front and back.This is IP 68 water resistance, which is the highest level.Google are not saying take the swimming, but it does offer some protection against waterand sand.So if Google was trying to create a phone that would be noticeable and stand out, they'vecertainly done it with this bar across the back.They call this the camera bar.And inside here is where all the magic is and what we're going to be focusing on forthe rest of this review.All right.So let's get to the good stuff that you came here for.And yes, I am going to be showing you pictures and video and also give you links where youcan download images and stuff.So what we've got in the back here is we have a camera bar.So this camera bar contains some different sensors.It contains an Led flash and three cameras.Let's talk about the cameras.The wide angle camera is a 50 megapixel camera.The ultra wide camera is a twelve megapixel camera, and then one that probably everyone'sgoing to be talking about is we've got this Zoom camera.It's a 48 megapixel Zoom that goes to four times optical Zoom and up to 20 times digitalZoom.What's really interesting about this is it's actually a Periscope camera.That means if you want to put the elements in the lens, the phone is a little too thinfor that.Right?So what they did is they built the elements going up this way.Put a 45 degree prism works just like a Periscope.And if they can get more optics inside the body than if they were to just do it in thewidth here or there, you would have the phone bar sticking out to here.And one of the things that Google has always been really good at is computational photography.And it's kind of always been their strong point.Now with the previous pixels, it was pretty good, but they were kind of held back by thehardware.Now they can really beef up the chip and the cameras in here to really take advantage ofit.So you've got the hardware mix of the computational photography, unlock some interesting things.One of them, of course, is portrait mode, which is not new or really unusual.Now, most phones have it.So what it does is it detects the subject and Blues the background.Now we have the ability to go in here and change the amount of blue, which is reallynice.So the interesting thing about this is handheld is I can pan with the subject and I don'teven have to be spot on.Like, in fact, I've got a car here and I'm just kind of following the car.What it does is it uses computational photography to determine what's the subject, what's thebackground adds.The blue background while taking the sharp part of the photo and using that and blendingit together kind of almost like masking instead of Photoshop.If I was to hold the camera still and use the action pan, what would happen is everythingwould be still and in the moving part would look blurry, which has its places.The other thing is long exposure.So we all know about long exposure.This is a way to create that beautiful flowing water use in waterfalls and fountains andthings like that.So the nice thing about that is using this.Once again, it keeps the areas that should be sharp, sharp and then takes that slow exposurefor the things that are moving, such as the water and then blends that together and givesus a shot that looks like we were using a tripod when in fact, it was just handheld.And of course, there's a photo of me in this shot and you can see there.It's just keeping the person nice and sharp blur in the background.Really love that.And also other amazing features in here, such as the magic eraser.It's like a ContentAware fill, which is directly inside the phone, which is really cool.So if you find something you don't want, just draw a circle around your finger and pressthough.It's gone.Now.Portrait Mode We mentioned that a little bit before we take a photograph of something boom,and then what it does is it blurs the background.We can adjust the amount of blur.But another interesting thing in here is we can actually take the light in portrait mode.We can actually go under our adjustments and we can choose the tools and under here wehave the ability to move the light and look at this.As I move the light around, you can see it's almost like I'm reliving a scene with an actuallight.It's really incredible.This is using, of course, the AI computational photography.All right.So then one of the things that I find interesting with the camera, too, is there's a littlelevel in here and it shows me when it's not level, but when I hit it right on level, Ifeel a slight little haptic feedback that lets me know I've got my camera level.And of course, this works in portrait and also in landscape mode.Now, when we go into the Zoom, we can Zoom all the way in.And this is really great.There's so many times when you want to Zoom like maybe you're doing wildlife or you'rea concert or you're an event, maybe you're not too close, you can Zoom in and you canget some really good photos and video.Speaking of video, they've really upped the game with the video because the pixels alwayshad really good photos.I would say in my arrival of the iphone photos, but the video always fell short in this case.Now they've really amped up the video.All right, so when we are in the video camera, one of the nice things about the video hereis that we have different stabilization modes.We've got standard, which is what you're going to be using most of the time.Locked is really awesome, because if we go into the locked mode here, this enables meto Zoom in.In fact, I can Zoom in really high.And what it will do is this will freeze this for me, and it will enable me to just holdit very steady for something that's not moving that I want to Zoom in really close.Then we have active when you're running around and doing different things like that.So I'm kind of shaking it a lot right now and you can see it's not really moving a loton the camera.It's holding up pretty stable.Pretty nice.Cinematic pan is awesome.Cinematic pan enables me to pan and look at this.We just get beautiful, smooth.All right, so those are the different types of stabilization.And then, of course, we can do slow motion.So when we go into slow motion, this is beautiful for things like water and different thingslike that.We can slow it down and we can adjust the amount of slow motion just by moving.See, when we're in slow motion there, we can go one 8th speed, we can go quarter speed,and we can change that.And of course, we can go into different cameras.Timelapse.Timelapse is awesome.Okay, so we've got different types of timelapse and even has some hints in here.Say, for example, you want to see a person walking on something that's going quite quickly,and you want to do that, something that's moving slowly.We go further up to the 120, something like a sunrise.We got moving clouds so we can adjust the amount that we want here, do it on any camera,of course.And then we can apply that.So watch this in portrait mode, and we can change to there and see how that depth fieldblur kind of happens.Look at this.So the foreground is sharp.Let me tap on the background now.It switches the focus.Look at that.Let's switch to the camera, switch back to the foreground and you can see it really hasa nice separation here.So that's looking at the camera and the computational photography that's inside of the new GooglePixel pro.I don't know about you, but I am very impressed with this camera.I'm really excited to see what I can do for the future.And I'll do a follow up later on.If you guys have any questions about this and maybe you want to know, drop a questioninto the comments, and I'll do my best to answer it.I'll also drop a link where you can go and have a look at some sample photos and footage.And if you are new and you haven't yet, subscribed, hit that subscribe button,

0sBcyvoILBA,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,this is the pixel 6 and i've been using it as  my sort of daily point-and-shoot camera for the  past three or so weeks here is the 10 things  that matter to me most about this phone from  the point of view of a photographer and if you  want to potentially win a pixel 6 stick around  till later in the video so guys reviews on this  phone have been out for a little while so we're  not going to focus too much on the general phone  performance specs but there are a few things that  are important to me as a user and a photographer  first of all is this phone is just seriously quick  it's actually the best android phone i've ever  used in terms of performance previously whenever  i've used android which has been quite a lot i've  always sort of missed iphones missed how smooth  ios is and i just don't at all when it comes to  using the pixel 6. i just genuinely absolutely  love it next is the battery life and again i'm  really really happy it was one of the original  reasons i left the iphone i definitely consider  walking around for most of the day taking quite  a lot of photos and videos to be pretty demanding  battery wise for a phone and i really rarely run  out of battery with the pixel with sort of  normal usage i probably end up with maybe 30  to 40 percent left on the battery and that's just  kind of a normal day's usage and the only times  i've actually ever ran the battery completely  flat when i've been shooting specifically for  a youtube video so the phone ends up being shot  with like way more than i ever normally would  if i was just out and about so the version i have  here is the pixel 6. this has two lenses on it's  got a 16 millimeter super wide angle lens and  then a standard 24 millimeter equivalent lens  the flagship pixel 6 pro also has 102 millimeter  telephoto and that's actually one of the main  advantages of buying that phone the other cameras  on the device are completely identical so you're  not losing any camera performance by choosing the  cheaper pixel 6. both of the lenses on this phone  are amazing and produce really good photos on the  primary 24 millimeter camera you're getting a 50  megapixel sensor that is pixel binning down to  a 12 megapixel photo essentially what that means  is taking a really nice rich 50 megabyte file  with lots of data and information and combining  that into a smaller file you're getting a lot of  benefit of that larger sensor size in the photo  this pixel building process really does result  in great photos with a high amount of detail  and because of that pixel binning low light shots  look really really good we will talk about that a  little bit more in detail later with the ultra  wide angle lens the sensor is 12.5 megapixels  so you don't get the sort of extra benefit that  you do with the pixel binning so photos won't be  quite as crisp as that 24 millimeter wide angle  lens but after a whole bunch of testing the  wide really does perform well and is actually my  favorite lens to use on this phone i do actually  wish that i'd spent the extra money to upgrade to  the pixel 6 pro because my favorite focal length  to shoot at generally anything above around 60  millimeters i just think it has a much nicer  compression and everything looks a little bit  better the reason i didn't is i have access to  other cameras bigger lenses so i don't  kind of actually need that 102 millimeter  but if this was if this is your only photography  device then you might want to upgrade to that and  that might want to be considered the power of  the pixel 6 like most flagship smartphones now  is not in the hardware it is in the software the  thing that impresses me most about the pixel 6 is  its capability to deal with crazy dynamic range  situations obviously you've been seeing a bunch  of skiing photos taken out in bright sunshine  on the mountains these make four very very hard  photos purely because of the amount of light in  the scene but time and time again you just get a  perfectly exposed photo looking really beautiful  on the pixel 6. essentially every time you take  a shot the pixel is taking multiple exposures  and combining them to retain as much detail as  possible there's so much computational power going  into each and every shot on this phone and it  does generally just mean you get great photos  almost every time you hit the shutter button  just take a look here at this side-by-side shot  and this is actually a video shot one of those  is from my canon and the other is from the pixel  i definitely think the canon looks a little bit  more natural but it is just crazy what the pixel  is able to do detail is really really good noise  levels look great i think my only complaint is  that the photos do actually look just a little  too sharp sometimes and this kind of is an  overall complaint of phone cameras in general  i think manufacturers use and add sharpness to  help the size of the sensors but it can and does  look quite artificial so guys i mentioned about  winning a pixel six so if this video reaches 5  000 likes i'm gonna be giving away a pixel 6  to someone who drops a comment down below just  comment once that's enough for one entry i know  it's a lot of likes but i think we can do it i  have to be honest i don't use portrait mode a  lot and this is mostly personal preference if  portraits were really important to me i'd actually  buy the pixel 6 pro which gains a 102 millimeter  lens which just due to the focal length would  actually give you a little bit more natural bokeh  in the background of your photos the portrait mode  on the pixel 6 is good but it's still not perfect  and still does have some fringing issues this kind  of really is more personal preference if portrait  mode is really important to you i don't think  you're going to be disappointed with this phone  nor do i think you're going to be delighted with  this phone i think it's kind of pretty solidly  standard flagship portrait mode performance  night photography with this camera is insanely  impressive it actually does a better job than some  of my more professional cameras and that's due  to that pixel binning and multiple exposures low  light photos are pretty famously difficult to take  especially if you have moving subjects in your  photographs but the computational power of this  phone means you can actually achieve really great  nighttime looking shots very very easily genuinely  it's super impressive and pretty much every  time i take a shot in low light with the pixel 6  my expectations are exceeded the motion modes are  really fun too and what's crazy about this is that  with both long exposure mode and action pan modes  these are very advanced photography techniques  that one take a lot of time to learn but two they  also require a ton of gear you have that problem  anymore though if you own a pixel throw away your  tripod nd filter remote controls and just tap the  long exposure button or the action pan button  and you'll be able to take really great shots  nice and easily the magic eraser is also really  cool especially if you're not someone who's  ever used photoshop as it really is super quick  and super simple to remove blemishes or people  from your photos directly on your phone with  no additional software required video is pretty  epic too the pixel shoots really beautiful high  quality 4k video the stabilization is excellent as  you would expect from a google flabship device by  default it shoots in 1080p so i bump this up to 4k  in the settings you might not want to do that  if you wanted to save storage space on your  device but overall yeah just super happy with  the video as well as the photo even as much as  i love the photos that come out of this camera  and the photography performance in general it's  not all good there are a few negatives the camera  on the pixel 6 does have a habit of making things  just look hdre i don't know if there's really  a technical term for that because it does such  an insane job at making almost all colors and  brightnesses pretty visible in each photo it  does come with this just compressing of colors  like you can see here and everything does just  look a bit artificial there is a manual shadow  control slider but it's not perfect to be honest  and everything still can very easily come out  looking pretty unnatural another thing and this is  something which i can spot a mile off with mobile  photography in general is that phones still just  digitally sharpen so much i know i briefly talked  about this earlier but it really is one of the  biggest giveaways of mobile photography in general  because there is so much processing happening  to these photos the software is doing a lot of  processing and adding a lot of sharpness to these  stills you can shoot raw which does definitely  fix some of these issues or at least let you  control them a little bit however the point of me  shooting with a smartphone is for ease and ease of  use so it's just not really a great solution to  be able to shoot raw because like i said i have  access to bigger cameras if i want to do that  if you do only have one camera and that's your  phone you might want to play around with shooting  raw though because it does improve some of the  potential output coming out of the camera bear in  mind though shooting raw does mean that you lose  some of the benefit of shooting with the phone  like those computational advantages some of the  dynamic range improvements that type of thing so  we've obviously sort of deep dived into the photos  but one last thing to note the actual biggest  negative with using the pixel 6 is actually  the fingerprint scanner the pixel uses on-screen  fingerprint reading tech and it's just genuinely  not that good in decent light when you can align  your finger perfectly it does normally work first  try but if you dim the screen brightness down or  maybe your finger doesn't sit perfectly in the  circle sometimes it says several times to scan or  just flat out won't work at all i know this is a  photography review but obviously with mobile phone  photography you are putting your camera away you  are taking your phone out a lot of the times  you're wanting to unlock your phone nice and  quickly and the fingerprint scanner is actually  genuinely one of the biggest negatives of owning  this phone so far for me but that doesn't attract  anything from the actual camera performance  overall the phone is amazing and it's meant that i  no longer feel like i have to bring bigger cameras  on every single trip with me cameras like this the  canon eos r6 are big and bulky so it's nice and  convenient that i can just take my phone in fact i  actually compared this pro camera the canon eos r6  to the pixel 6 side by side so if you have enjoyed  this video why don't you go give that one a watch
ARWM7Ug_DSk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,for those of you that do not speakarabic that means peace be upon you soyou learn something new every day forthe last week or so i have put my iphoneand apple watch in a drawer untouchedignored abandoned neglected all of theabove and i have moved the center of mydaily life really the center of myindividual existence to android and morespecifically thishere are my thoughts and review of thegoogle pixel 6 pro[Music]design wise the google pixel 6 propretty much looks like every otherflagship android smartphone there isthat is true until you turn it around onthe back google went for quite anunorthodox camera layout and honestly ireallydig itwhen i first saw it i was really takenaback by it but after holding it andusing it for some time it really doeshonestly quite grow on youon the front the pixel 6 pro and pixel 6are both protected by corning gorillaglass victus which google says is thetoughest gorilla glass in any smartphonenow while i can't specifically vouch forthat statement what i can tell you isthat as i was recording footage for thisvideo my pixel took a i want to say atleast a meter glass first smack rightonto marble flooring i picked it up andit was completely fine without a nick ora scuff or any damage at all i'm prettyconvinced that if that was an iphone iwould be on my way to an apple storeright about now one aspect of the pixel6 pro design that i really don't like isthe placement of the buttons for someweird reason google decided to place thepower and volume up and volume downbuttons on the right side of the phonewhile the left side is completely emptyof anything other than the sim cardtrack i don't know what google'srationale was with this design choicebut it's incredibly annoying tasks liketaking a screenshot which require you tohold the power button and volume downbutton at the same time are madepractically impossible because of theplacement of the buttons other than thatthe pixel 6 has a really gorgeous designand i quite like it the one thing that idid notice using it without a case isjust how incredibly slippery it is so iwould advise that if you are going touse it without a case really make surethat you have a tight grip on it or youcould just always go and get a dbrandskinned not sponsoredon the front the pixel has a gorgeous6.7 inch oled qhd plus display with thehole punch right at the top there arebezels on the top and bottom but they'rearguably just thick enough to preventaccidental clicks and really not thatnoticeable and the display does curveever so slightly on either sidethe display is what you should expectfrom a high-end flagship phone withpunchy and vibrant colors and prettygood viewing angles and while googleisn't explicitly stating how many nitsof brightness the display has it getsplenty of bright both indoors and outcompared to its younger pixel 6 thepixel 6 pro's 299 dollar premium meansyou're going to get a 120 hertz refreshrate display now if this was an iphone13 pro review i would almost certainlyrecommend that premium over the standardfor that higher refresh rate but ireally can't say the same for the pixel6. google's implementation of thetechnology feels lackluster and lackingand apps really don't seem to be takingfull advantage of the display's hardwarejust yetthe pixel 6 pro and the pixel 6 are bothpowered by the google tinser chipgoogle's first semi-custom silicon forits pixel lineup and it's a really goodchip on paper it has a custom machinelearning model a custom isp 12 gigs ofram it is really accumulation ofgoogle's years of investment in machinelearning neural networking photorecognition and more all jam-packed intoa single five nanometer process in realworld performance it stacks up to thecompetition i really didn't notice thephone lag or stutter in my day-to-daywhereabouts switching between apps andmultitasking is smooth and seamlessespecially with 12 gigs of ram wheregoogle tensor really shines though is inmachine learning computation a big partof the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 proselling point is how they are googlephones and nothing says google more thanmachine learning so features liketranslation transcription photorecognition and more really shinethrough on google tensor one of myfavorite features is something googlecalls live caption live caption lets youtranscribe a video in real time but ontop of that you can actually translate atranscription as it's transcribing thevideo so if you're playing a video infrench it will transcribe the video infrench then take that transcription andtranslate it to english italian germanjapanese or the other languages that itcurrently supports it's really reallycoolit wouldn't be a review if we didn'ttalk about battery life the pixel 6 prohas a 5 000 milliamp battery and eventhough it's a really large battery thatdoesn't always tell you the full storywhat does is softer integration and howefficient the chip that the phone runson actually is in my experience with mypixel 6 pro i was finishing my day witharound 40 to 45 of battery left which isquite good one reason for that is afeature that google calls adaptivebattery and it's actually not a newfeature it pretty much lets the phonelearn how you use your phone in adaptbackground app usage depending on yourusage it does take a while for thesystem to adapt but once it does youwill definitely notice another thing tonote with my experience is that whilethe pixel 6 and pixel 6 pro both support5g my carrier doesn't so i was testingmy pixel 6 pro on lte 4g and wifioverall battery life is pretty goodon the back the pixel 6 pro has a 15megapixel wide camera lens with an f1.85 aperture and an 82 degree field ofview but you really don't care about thenumbers you care about the photos ittakes and what i can tell you is that ittakes really really good photos now idid compare it to my iphone but before ishow you pictures i do want to say thatsearching for differences in them islike looking for a needle in a haystackit's going to be hard to directly findone unless you're actively looking fordifferences[Music]one thing i did notice with the pixel 6and the pictures it took is thatwhenever the sun was in the frame itreally over exposed it it made the skylook less blue and more white than itactually was it just kind of seemedwashed outbut in other photos i do think the pixeldid nail colors a little bit better theyjust seemed more vibrant and lifelikecompared to the iphone which kind ofseemed just dull and flat ultimatelyboth phones took really good photos andit's really hard to nail an exact winnerin the wide lens department the pixel 6pro has a 12 megapixel ultra wide camerawith an f 2.2 aperture and a 114 degreefield of view now that field of view islower than the iphone which has a 120degree field of view and that extrafield of view definitely came in clearin these photos the iphone wasdefinitely able to get more in the shotfrom the relatively same standpoint inthe photos themselves i do feel like theiphone did a better job of balancing thecolors and the pixel photo just kind ofseemed a little bit dark and washed outone of the coolest new cameras on thepixel 6 pro is the telephoto lens whichis actually a periscope lens it's a 48megapixel lens that has 4x optical zoomand up to 20x of digital zoom which areboth higher than the latest iphones butas always the numbers don't always tella full story and you guessed it bothphones take really good close-up zoomedin photosas is the same with the previousexamples i do still think that the pixelhad just a little bit more poppy vibrantcolors but the iphone did have sharperand more crisp detail if you zoomed inon this specific photo on the leaves andon the tomato it just seems to have beena little bit more crisp i feel like i'msaying this a lot during this review butboth phones took really good photos butfor me personally i do prefer the colorsand the pictures that the pixel tookover those of the iphone but againlooking for differences in these photosare really really difficult and unlessyou're actively looking out for changesyou're not going to notice themon the front the pixel 6 pro has an 11.1megapixel camera and out of all of thecamera tests that i didlooking at the front-facing images itook on my pixel compared to my iphonewas probably the hardest to try and finddifferences of so i'm just going to showyou the images i took and you can kindof decide for yourselfone thing to note with the front-facingcamera on the pixel 6 is that it iscapable of recording 4k at 30 frames persecond the iphone's front-facing camerais capable of 4k 60 frames per second sotake that for what it's worthin low light in nighttime photographyboth phones did really wellall right noone did really well and one didn't do sogoodfor me the pixel was just adisappointment in low-light shots inevery shot that i took with the pixel itjust made everything white the colortemperature was completely off plus asit was trying to compensate for the lackof light it also lost quite a lot ofdetail the iphone on the other hand wasmuch more realistic in terms of thelighting and the temperature and wasalso able to keep quite a good detailleft in the shots so really the iphoneagain takes the w in low light shotssomething about that iphonenow let's talk about video both phonesare capable of recording up to 4k at 60frames per second and they're quite goodi know you're getting tired of me sayingthis but there's really not much else ican saywhile the pixel took much better colorsand vibrancy in photos the iphone seemsto have a little bit more punchy andvibrant colors and videosultimately though that's a really smalldifference and you can kind of decidefor yourselves[Music]the pixel 6 pro has four different modesof video stabilization a standard modewhich is what i think a lot of peopleare just going to keep it on cinematiclocked and active i think they're eachpretty self-explanatory but honestly inmy testing they all performed reallywell active was a little bit better ifyou're actually running oractivethe last android i used was the samsunggalaxy s6 edge in 2016. to say thatandroid has changed a lot since thenwould be an understatement so i wasinitially really excited to try outandroid 12 and material u which isgoogle's new design language now itsounds great on paper and it looksreally good in marketing pictures but inreal world practice it's quite adisappointment all it really means isthat if you change the wallpaper thesystem is going to detect prominentcolors in that wallpaper and change thesystem menu buttons and controls tomatch those colors it's cool but quitehonestly it feels like a gimmick ichanged my wallpaper a few times and yesit does change the look and feel of yourphone but it's really not that big of adeal there are also new android 12widgets which do adopt to those colorsbut no third party app i found at leastsupported those new widgets onlygoogle's own custom stock apps now whilematerial u is in my opinion adisappointment it's still in its earlystages and i want to give google benefitof the doubt that it is going to getbetter in so many ways the currentandroid experience on pixel reminds meof a more premium version of ios nowdon't get me wrong the androidexperience on pixel is far morecustomizable than ios has ever been youcan change the grid size on your homescreen place icons and widgets anywherebut simple things like being able toeasily reorder or rearrange your homescreen pages is not something you can dotake this for example the google pixelhas a feature called at a glance whichis kind of google's take on sirisuggestions its goal is to show usersrelevant information throughout the dayso if you're about to board a flight itmight show you your boarding pass or ifyou're heading to a meeting it mightshow you your travel time to work theweather and so forth it resides on thelock screen and your home screen on thetop row but the most annoying thing isthat you can't get rid of it even if youturn off at a glance that row on yourhome screen stays and it's utterlyannoying it's an entirely wasted growthat 99 of the time is gonna remainempty one aspect of the pixel experiencethat i would really like apple to adoptis how it handles notifications and howyou can actually manage them on ios ifyou want to fine-tune a specific app'snotifications you actually have to gointo that app go through its settingsfind the notifications page and go fromthere on pixel on some apps you canactually just do it straight from thesystem so you can turn off notificationsfor messages and you can even go as faras customizing notifications you get forspecific peopleall right sammy cut to the chaseis the pixel 6 pro worth ityesyes it isif there's always an if or a buttin this case it is and if you are deeplyinvested into the google ecosystem andgoogle experience if you're a heavy userof google assistant google photos googledrive and all the other google servicesthen you are not going to get a betterexperience than with the pixel 6 and thepixel 6 pro but if you're someone whojust wants the best of the best hardwarethen the pixel 6 pro really isn't foryouin that case i'd recommend the galaxys22 ultra or some other high-end androidflagship out there what you are gettingwith the pixel 6 pro is a very smartintelligent experienceso to put it simply with the pixel 6 proyou are definitely in very smart handsuntil next time take care and masalamafor those of you that also be carebreakthat means

G9X-LPiqjOg,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"So before the Pixel 7 Pro launch event, everyone  and even their dogs knew that Google is expected  to offer a very minimal hardware upgrade with  the Pixel 7 lineup. An upgrade so small that even  Apple would feel ashamed who were notoriously  known for offering minimal upgrades year after  year. But a lot of us knew that Google is less  about hardware and more about software. After  the launch event, the hype for the Pixel 7 Pro is  more than ever because turning out the Pixel 7 Pro  is the Pixel 6 Pro that we truly never got. This is especially true with the camera. You see  people keep telling that iPhones have the best  video camera. And with my experience with the  iPhone 14 Pro Max, that is absolutely true.  You can easily tell that it's better than the  S22 Ultra's video recording. I'll upload the  review video tomorrow but right now it seems,  Google is giving Apple a run for its money.  A YouTuber named Michael secret has got access  to the Pixel 7 Pro early and he's been  testing out the camera of the handset.  And honestly, it's really impressive what  Google has managed to achieve in just a  year with just their software magic.  First of all, switching between the lenses  is smooth as ever almost like the iPhones.  And quite impressed with the super res zoom  quality. It takes a second or so to kick in but  when it does, it creates that Google magic to  turn a blurry video into a super sharp one.  And as you can see Google just nailed the  HDR and the colors. Even when he is moving,  it doesn't shift colors which the 14 Pro Max  does it sometimes. And look at how it captures  the sun. The Pixel 7 Pro easily has the best  HDR I've ever seen. I'll link the full video  down in the description, do check that out.   And not just the camera, it seems Google has also  nailed the Pixel 7 Pro with its battery life.  This user Danny Silvester has also got the phone  early and he's been testing out the battery life,  he charged his battery at 07:30 in the morning  and he's been recording 4K 60fps videos, photos,  playing Kenshin impact a heavy graphic intensive  game, and general usage. And after 07:50  pm over 12 hours later, the phone still has 49%  charge which is impressive. I would say it's on  par with the S22 Ultra. The Pixel 6 Pro doesn't  have a great battery life so it seems Google  has nailed the optimization part as well.  By the way, he also mentions that while playing  genshin impact, the phone doesn't heat up. In  fact, he says the phone doesn't heat up at all  during his full day of usage which is surprising  because it's Samsung who's manufacturing these  chipsets. Anyway, although Google didn't say  how bright the screen is he mentions that the  display is easily visible in direct sunlight.  I'm sure it's not 2000 nits like the 14 Pro Max  but it should be somewhere in the range of 1500  nits. He also uploaded some picture samples and  the zoom quality is as good as the S22 Ultra. Considering that the Pixel 7 Pro is $300 cheaper  than Samsung and Apple's best, and it's going  toe to toe with their latest flagships and even  doing better in some cases is a big win  for Google, for the general consumers,  and for the future of the Pixel lineup.  To know the top 5 new features of the Pixel  7 Pro click here and I'll see you  tomorrow...peace out  "
B9SCKaV-7eY,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,today we have the in-depth review  of the pixel 6 in the pixel 6 pro  and that's coming up right after this!after the overview of both new pixel 6 phones  it's time to dig deeper look at everything this  phone has to offer before we get started though  smash the like button if you're a fan of google  let me know in the comments who out  there is interested in the pixel 6  if you haven't already then hit subscribe  now so you don't miss a thing in the future  we've already covered the differences between  the pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro but if you did  miss that video then hit the shortcut in the top  right corner now and check that out first but for  today's video we're going to be focusing on the  software performance the gaming performance and  of course the camera so first of all we've got  the new software we've got the updated android 12  which they're calling material you it's the  biggest ui change we've seen for some time  we've got a new lock screen rounded widgets and  a lot more subtle feature upgrades to improve the  android experience we've got a 90 Hz display  on the pixel 6 and 120 Hz on the pixel 6 pro  so both phones are giving a nice smooth experience  it comes turned on by default but for those who  do want to go back to 60hz you can also turn  that off in settings but the battery has easily  lasted me the day for both of these phones so  i would recommend keeping smooth display on  when you select your wallpaper and lock screen  material you now adapts to your background you'll  find the colors used in your background are now  used all over the interface it's the colors from  your background as well as the complementary  colors the white backgrounds that tend to have  a color tint matching your background in apps  and settings it goes even further if i open up  the calculator you can see these dynamic color  changes some calculator buttons are different  colors and if we go back and change the wallpaper  then open up the calculator again you'll see new  colors based on my new background this is also  the same across other apps like photos and camera  the search function is laid out much better than  before and you can search through apps people app  shortcuts and actions settings assistant actions  and tips for the first time on a pixel we've also  got an in-display fingerprint scanner and this  is on the pixel 6 as well as the pixel 6 pro the  scanner is great and it works well but it does  have a slight delay to unlock it probably takes  just over a second to unlock so it's not the  fastest unlock but it does work accurately now  unfortunately when the display is fully turned  off pressing over the fingerprint area does  not unlock the phone and you have to press the  power button first and then use the fingerprint  it does however have raised to wake so if it's on  a table or you've just pulled it out your pocket  the screen is going to automatically turn  on and then you just unlock with your finger  the speech to text has also been improved further  this is a test to check that the speech to text  works well on the google pixel 6. so great for  those of you that use dictation and voice to text  we've also got live translate which translates any  message and if you're watching foreign media you  can enable subtitles in your own language this  seems to work well and it's not only for videos  and media but it's also in games in pretty much  anything where voice is coming through your phone  there's also an interpreter mode should you be in  a situation where you need to talk to someone that  can't speak your language it's going to listen to  both languages and translate them both how are youhow are you we've got improvements to at a glance  where it shows you upcoming useful information on  your home screen so this is going to be weather  alerts travel appointments and commute time to  home i find this very useful as when i forget  about an appointment it's there on my home screen  so i don't miss it and if you're out and about  it pre-warns you if there's going to be traffic  on your way home now one thing i've noticed  with both pixel 6 phones is that because of  the very glossy backs if i put them on any surface  with a slight slope or even on the arm of a sofa  they slide off and fall on the floor now it's not  really an issue and of course for those of you  that are using protective cases it's not going  to matter but i found a few times when i'm not  paying attention i hear my pixel hit the floor now  on the plus side to this despite me having it fall  quite a few times now there's not a single mark  on either pixel on the performance side of things  both phones use google's new tensor chipset and  the main differences between the 6 and the 6  pro is that the pixel 6 has 8 gigabytes of ram and  the pixel 6 pro has 12. when it comes to synthetic  benchmarks interestingly enough the standard pixel  6 scores better than the pixel 6 pro now the pixel  6 has a single core score of 1047 and a multicore  score of 2949 if we compare this to the pixel 6  pro it gets 1020 single core and 2730 multi now  the reason for the better scores on the pixel 6  is most likely due to the pixel 6 pro at not only  having a higher refresh rate but also a higher  resolution display the pixel 6 has a resolution  of 1080 by 2400 whereas the pixel 6 pro is 1440  x 3120 they're both using the same chipset so  rendering is going to be harder for the pixel  6 pro for comparison the s21 ultra on geekbench 5  leaderboard gets 924 for single core and 3085 for  multi so the google tensor is pretty much on par  performance wise with the snapdragon triple eight  now when it comes to gaming i've tried lots of  games and with call of duty in the hd resolution  pack it runs smoothly and it's enjoyable to play  on both phones i prefer the pixel 6 pro for gaming  just because of its premium fill its larger  display and the higher resolution but that's  just my personal preference it's the same chipset  in both phones so the pixel 6 is still great for  gaming and given the performance is on par  with the snapdragon 8 you'll be able to play  all of the latest games and go for the high detail  option just for the pixel 6 pro you'll be getting  a higher resolution on the other side to that  because they've got the same chipset if you're  on a very demanding game because the pixel 6 has  a lower resolution you'll probably find you get  higher frame rates next up we have the camera and  the pixel 6 continues to provide the great photos  we've come to expect from a pixel phone whatever  the scene or lighting situation the pixel 6  does a great job whether you choose the pixel 6 or  the pixel 6 pro you get a 50 megapixel main sensor  and a 12 megapixel ultrawide and in my testing  they perform exactly the same between both phones  the photos look great and the colors are pretty  true to life with all my photos that they were  simply point and shoot and they've all come out  well retaining plenty of detail and color now i've  just used the auto settings for every photo and  overall this is pretty much what i was expecting  from the pixel the advantage of the pixel 6 pro  it comes with an additional 48 megapixel telephoto  and this allows for four times optical zoom and  it's something that is missing from the standard  pixel 6. the pixel 6 allows for up to seven times  super red zoom which is still digital zoom whereas  the pixel 6 pro gets four times optical and then  20 times digital if we compare the two with zoom  shots side by side you can see it makes a huge  difference with the pixel 6 pro keeping its high  quality through the four times zoom and then also  having the option to go for 20 times now of course  it 20 times that because this is digital zoom  we've got a considerable loss of detail now here's  an example of the same photo from the primary lens  and the four times zoom lens and as you can see  i'd say the full time zoom lens isn't quite as  good and detailed as the primary lens but it's  still delivering a good quality photo for four  times zoom the night sight seems to perform pretty  much the same as previous pixels gives us good  detail and great lighting in a night shot where  there really wasn't much visibility at all on the  video front it records great quality 4k video with  impressive stabilization i can walk around turn  and shoot anywhere and the stabilization is great  now overall i'm happy with the video quality but  just sometimes there does seem to be this slight  flicker if there's any heavy step or sunlight  hitting the lens and in some video instances  there's also a bit of noise in the dark patches  of the scenes such as you can see on the shadows  of the grass overall though i am happy with the  video from the pixel 6 it's not groundbreakingly  amazing but it's definitely good enough for those  of you that want 4k at 60 frames a second you can  only do this from the primary wide camera  the ultrawide camera can record at 4k but  only at 30 frames a second and you can see here  that produces good video footage but of course  it just doesn't feel as smooth as the 60 frames  a second we can also shoot 60 frames a second at  1080p from the ultrawide though and as you can  see here it's nice and smooth again just much  less detail given the resolution drop to 1080p  the telephoto is also restricted to 1080p at 60  frames a second or 4k at 30. but you can see  here at 4k30 it produces a pretty good video  and even while walking the stabilization is good  you can see some flicker while stepping but of  course if this is four times zoom you should  really be still when filming in zoom when it  comes to the selfie cameras the video on the pixel  6 pro is considerably better than the pixel 6 as  it does have a better camera the pixel 6 pro has  an 11.1 megapixel selfie camera and the pixel  6 only has an 8 megapixel camera and then on top  of this the pixel 6 pro has a wider field of view  so this is a video from the pixel 6 pro on the  selfie camera this is at one time zoom but it  does also let you go 1.4 you see it's a sunny  day so lots of light cold some shadows there  but all in all it looks like a pretty good  picture the pixel 6 pro is also recording at 4k  30 frames a second with the pixel 6 is restricted  to 1080p at 30 so there is a big difference here  i would say there is a noticeable difference  between the two the pixel 6 pro is definitely  coming out on top and this is also apparent in  photos as well but both phones are perfectly fine  for selfies and portraits on the photo front we've  also got new features such as the magic eraser and  the face and blur the magic eraser works okay  and it's similar to photoshop's healing brush  you can select unwanted parts of  the photo and simply remove them  it works well for items in the backdrop of a  photo but if they're close i find it tends not  to work very well at the moment with the objects  being removed but you can see something was there  we've also got face on blur and this means if you  had slight movement in the photo that's caused  some blur it is going to sharpen things up but the  face and blur is not a tool you use afterwards it  actually works automatically and you'll know if it  used it as it will tell you in your photo gallery  overall though i'm a fan of both smartphones the  pixel 6 is 599 or 599 pounds and it seems good  value for everything you get with it you get  a guaranteed five years of updates some great  photography and a capable phone for photos video  and gaming if you want to step up to the pro it's  899 or 849 pounds and personally i do prefer the  pro just because of the more premium looking feel  as well as the larger 120 hertz display now of  course it is almost 300 more so if you don't need  those extra features it brings then it may not  be worth it but that being said the selfie camera  is that little bit better so if you do need  it for selfies then it could be a good option  now both phones are a big change in design for  google and it's nice to see something completely  different but still priced relatively well i was  hoping for slightly better video performance than  we've got at the moment but it could improve  the software and with everything else in mind  it's not a bad choice for pixel fans so that's  pretty much it for today's video so as always  if you've got any questions or there's anything  i've missed then just leave them in the comments  below and i'll get back to you as soon as i can  but thanks for watching the video if you liked  it smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next oneyou
N5OwxKvvlPE,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,this video is sponsored by kstify[Music]is this even a fair comparison in manyways i think it's quite unfair becauseof you know how far apart some of thespecs are in other ways i think there'sdefinitely an argument for picking oneover the other i've had the galaxy s 22ultra and the pixel 6 pro for a fewmonths now there are things that ireally love about them and certainthings that i wish were better in bothto be fairbut if i was to pick one which one wouldit be and and why look i know the pixel7 has just been announced and we havethe pixel 6a to consider too but i'mputting those options in a separatevideo for you right now let's have achat about these two over here i'm alexand i do down-to-earth tech reviews ifthat's something you like welcome to thechannel the s22 ultra is currently about1200 if you don't trade in and if youdon't get any discountit is a beautiful device right with astriking design that actually dividedsome opinion personally i still preferthe look of the s21 ultra phantom brownespecially this is probably one of myfavorite phones everthe s22 ultra doesn't exactly disappointfrom a design perspective i do like itand i like when companies kind of try todo something a little bit differentunlike appleand talking about something a little bitdifferent the google pixelthe google pixel 6 pro has a fantasticdesign i've been an apple user for thelongest time i've got macbook pro i'vegot ipads you know thisis in my workflow and i can't get out ofit right but the pixel 6 pro is nothingshort of amazing i think it's quite anunderrated device actually i just lovehow it feels in the hand you know it'sreally kind of i like the weight andthis this visor looking in the camera aswell it really makes you feel verycomfortable to hold very safe as welleven though it's quite slippery thiskind of gives you a bit of support atthe back here i think it's super elegantand it looks amazing in every situationand depending on the lighting thatyou've got it just oozes classes for mewhen it comes to design the winner forme is the pixel 6 pro and i would evensay that this design is better than theiphone 13 pro max which i really liketooand google are not sitting still rightthe pixel 7 has already been announcedand it's said to be another crackingdevice now let's divert our attention tothe display on these phones and i'm notgonna be around the bush on this onewhen it comes to the display the s22ultra just wins it for me samsung arethe absolute king of this place right ihaven't had every single smartphone outthere but i've had the 13 pro maxrecently and i've had the s21 ultraso i have a pretty decent idea of what agood display should feel like andsamsungwow it's it's not just how bright it isit's just unbelievable when it comes towatching content right especially whenyou watch hdr content indoors outdoorsit doesn't matter it crushes througheverything you can totally edit photosusing this display you know to a decentlevel of quality as well using somethinglike adobe lightroom and and you can seehere right this is just incredible butthe pixel 6 pro is no slouch right hehas a fantastic display too with 120hertz refresh rate and the ability to godown to 10 hertz as well to save batteryif he needs to yes it's definitelynowhere near as bright as the s22 ultrabut come on this is a beautiful displaytoo for the price you're getting apretty decent package here you know as imentioned at the beginning of the videoi'm doing another video talking aboutthe pixel 7 and whether you should waitor go for the 6a instead or pick thisone but stay tuned for that one now onething that i findhilarious on tech reviews aboutsmartphones is that no one everincluding myselftalks about call quality so come with meand my dog chalky[Music]so here we are in the middle of nowherein england trying to review hissmartphone and wait for it i'm going tomake a phone call this is the s22 ultrawe're going to try and call my friendpatrick in in belgium we're just goingto be using telegram so which review areyou doinguh this is the s22 ultra vs pixel 6 proyeah it's crispnice yeah you sound pretty pretty goodas well all right so this is my matehe's a music producer johnny how are youokaygood thank you how are you awesome thankyou mate and it seems very stereo kindof soundwhen you talkokay really clear actually yeah do youwant to talk to me a little bit aboutyour latest song have you released ityet yeahi'll send the link to youto have a listen you're not gonna claimcopyright on my on my videos are youi thought that was actually louder andclearer than the pixel 6 pro soimpressive results here but let me knowwhat you thoughtdefinitely just been out and changedshirts and stuff yeah totally noexpenses spared here you know we diddrone shots multiple angles you name itall for you and all i ask in return ifyou like my stuff anyway is for you tohit the subscribe button i'm here withnew videos weekly and there's a ton ofvideos already in the channel that youcan enjoy here at your own leisuresticking with a fun aspect right wegotta mention the cameras now ratherthan tell you megapixels and frames persecondlet's just look at some shots i reallythink the samsung is just much betterhere and that is obviously because ofthat better hardware but the pixel 6 prodefinitely punches above its way herenow for the price you're getting amazingresults it delivers incrediblephotographs in every condition when itcomes to video however the pixel justhas some work to do in my opinion i havenoticed though that recently after someupdates he has gotten better and thepixel updates similar to the samsung aswell actually they just take too longfor me and for that reason it shouldcome as no surprise to you that i thinkthe s22 ultra is the better device whenit comes to the cameras one thing thatyou might be worried about on this phoneis how exposed the camera module is onboth of them trust me i learned this thehard way so this is a good opportunityfor me to bring up today's sponsors kt5they sent me a lovely collection ofcases here with a discount code for youas well for the s22 ultra they've gotthese lovely new launches here whichfeature castify's trademark protectioni've been using their cases for a longtime with different devices as well soyou'll find quite a few videos here onthe channel including drop tests youknow they offer six point six foot dropprotection so that's pretty awesome caseof five cases for me you know they'rereally grippy and very very stylish youknow they're compatible with allwireless chargers out there as you cansee here no issues charging with acouple of different cases and differentchargesno problem they have their own designmaterial as well called she-tech whichthey've just upgraded and tested toreduce the impact by 95 percentyou know that's quite a lot ofprotection you're getting here you thinkthat with all of that protection itwould be a bulky case but no they'revery sleek and thin you know i'm justholding the pixel 6 pro here and it'sit's almost like it wasn't there it'sreally thin really kind of not adding alot to the phone i love the protectionat the front as well with these raisedbezels so you know when you put yourphone down it's not going to scratch thescreen despite that raised bezel youdon't lose that swipe ability rightespecially on the s22 ultra when youhave this kind of extra trace that yougot here on on one ui you can pull upfrom the side no issues doing that noissues removing the pen or using the peneither if anything it makes it better touse the pen because now you've got a lotmore grip on the device when you'reholding it with the pixel i'll go as faras saying that you could potentiallyrock it naked and still be okay becauseit's got a visor at the back that youcan use as a kind of asupport for your hand but the s22 ultrais virtually impossible to hold with ourcase and don i know that rightstill hurts i love the pixel 6 pro casesthey send me as well here there's somany more cool designs so this one islike a japanese style one not gonna liei love the look of the pixel 6 prowithout a case but if i'm going out thephone is going in the case there'sabsolutelyno argument there the protection aroundthe camera is really good on both phonesyou get a traditional case to findbranding around the camera module andmore importantly you can put the phonedown with the camera module facing downwithout worrying about scratching thecamera module which on both devicesare in their own wayfairly exposed now casey 5 has anothertrick up their sleeve which is thecustomization optionsyes they offer fantastic protectionthat's the main reason why you shouldget case but what i really love aboutthem is how you can pretty much find astyle to suit any style this could be alovely present right either for for aloved one or for yourself there's alsothe fact that we're going back tonormality and summer is nearly here soyou can show off a different style whenyou go on a holiday or to a festival orwhatever really cool and thatcustomization is pretty unique

understand that wecontent creators have some bills to payas well and it helps the channel youknow with every sponsorship that i getall of that money gets reinvested intoactually affording to buy these devicesand invest back in videos for youtalking about builds and working thesamsung s22 ultra has something that noother phone has at least i haven'treally seen it yet it is one of the mostunderrated features on any smartphonethis is samsung dex why i'm holding thepixel and i'm talking about this onei don't know why i haven't used thisfeature before on a smartphone but it'sfantastic basically it lets you use yourdevice connected to a display which willgive you a full-on sort of desktopexperienceit's incredible i could do an entirevideo on this and showing you howpowerful decks can be but this video isalready getting quite long so i'll leavea link down below where i'll show decksin a little more detail when i'mreviewing this bad boy here the tab saultra but what i will say here though isi really appreciate when companies pushthe boundaries and try to innovateapple take notes i really wish androidapps would get even better so that wecould enjoy thisphone features even more because that'sbecoming the main limitation here for meios apps by contrast are developed muchquicker right soand i know this because i've worked inthe tech industry for for many years andi've seen first hand when companies makedecisions on which app to develop firstand ios gets a prioritynine times out of ten if not ten timesout of ten from an audio quality thespeaker's perspective this is alwaystricky to test and share with you on avideo there's my recording microphonethere's the environment around herethere's background noise there'sprocessing obviously me editing thisvideo but we're gonna do it anyway i'mgonna use spotify but i made sure that ihave the settings the exact same on bothdevices from a quality perspective[Music]right let me know in the comments whichone you reckon was better and whileyou're down there comment with the wordlegend so that i know you've watchedthis far also because if you watch thisfar it does make you a legend thanks forthat clearly these are not my mainphones right now not yet anyway i amconsidering a switch consistently i pickone or the other in the evening insteadof my iphone 13 pro max the iphone isthe one i use at work andkind of during the day for my work callsand emails but when i'm having funespecially in the evenings just browsingthe socials and watching content i gofor one of these and the main reason isbecause they're just comfortable to usethiskind of aspect ratio helps as well thefact that you can hold them for longerwithoutyou know kind of hurting your handsit's it's a bonus as well i do love thedesign on the iphone 13 pro max i lovethe kind of squared off design to lookat it'sbut to hold it for a long time yeah it'squite a heavy andunwieldy device if you're coming from anolder device or an iphone 12 for examplethen i think you're definitely going tosee a jump coming to the s22 ultra thedisplay alone might be enough right ireally really want to love this phone asmuch as i did the s21 ultra and despitethe amazing cameras and the displayand the battery life as well it's prettygood it's just not hitting the mark forme another aspect that i think isoverlooked in tech reviews is theartificial intelligence aspect andbefore you roll your eyes about the aii'd rather we didn't have to hold thedevice at all you know it's this kind ofrectangular shape since that's the formfactor we seem to be stuck withwe may as well have some features thatmay be useful and the pixel 6 pro for meis the goat when it comes to reallybeing an assistant the s22 ultra hassimilar features and bixby is gettingbetterbut i'd still put bixi and siri in thesame boxin a corner far away from mei'm quite lucky to be able to try thesedifferent smartphones and i'm sure i'llbe trying some different ones as wellbut if i was forced to choose oneandroid device right now to spend therest of the year withi would go with the pixel 6 prosorry samsung but you are letting medown on this one i always try to be asunbiased as possible i love tech ingeneral and i hope that comes through inthe video i have some great pixel videosthat i've done for you over here and mys22 ultra videos can be found on thisplaylist over here i'll seeyou

cFF0bQiHysY,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"So Google's Pixel 7 Pro is yet to go on sale but Google is already confident that the Pixel7 and 7 Pro will break all the sales records of the Pixel phones.Google never really cared about the hardware, their phones never really were competitivecompared to Samsung's flagships.But that changed last year with the Pixel 6 Pro, a Google phone that was finally competitivewith the latest offerings from the competition and despite all the bugs, the Pixel 6 wasa successful handset.It sold more units than the Pixel 4 and 5 combined.And now, the company has even higher hopes for the Pixel 7 lineup, Google is going allin and has asked its suppliers to produce more than eight million Pixel 7 units.So basically this means Google wants to double the sales of their latest flagships comparedto last year.Google has also ordered 4 million budget Pixel units so combined the company is expectingto sell at least 12 million Pixel phones in the next 12 months.This is good news because of the competition.I mean basic economic theory demonstrates that when companies have to compete for customers,it leads to lower prices, higher quality devices and services, greater variety, and more innovation.Samsung was getting comfortable at the top as they didn't have a real mainstream competitorin the Android world.But 8 million Pixel 7 sales would surely make Samsung reconsider its strategy going forwardand that is a win-win situation for everyone.Moving on, yesterday we saw that Google has drastically improved the video recording capabilityof the Pixel 7 Pro even with the same hardware thanks to software optimization.And now, Google has shared some camera samples and the improvements they are bringing tothe super res zoom.And I like what I see here, especially this picture of the World Trade Center.Even with 30x zoom, it's very clear.But I can't say the same with the golden gate bridge, it looks like it was enhanced withAI.But overall these pictures look phenomenal.Of course...it's not the ride but the rider.These are probably taken by a professional photographer so I guess we'll have to waitfor the real-world camera review to really know how good it is.Anyway, here's some good news for Pixel 6 users.You see the Pixel 7 has some new features such as Clear Calling which improves the qualityof phone calls by cleaning up background noise, Similarly, Google has expanded its quick phrasefunctionality to end an incoming call by saying 'silence'.Another new feature is “Guided Frame” which leverages Google’s AI focus on itschips to help blind users take selfie photos.Google has also made improvements to Real Tone and spatial audio with the Pixel 7.Now Google has confirmed that Pixel 6 users will get all these features via a featuredrop in December.The only thing that's not coming is the face unlock for some reason.To see the video recording capability of the Pixel 7 Pro click here and I'll see you tomorrow...peaceout"
RocRA-3LA2s,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"So after months of anticipation, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are finally official.These handsets have a lot of AI tricks up their sleeves thanks to the new Tensor chip,so let's take a look at the top 10 features that truly separate the Pixel 6 and 6 Profrom the competition.Magic eraser One of the coolest camera features of thePixel 6 is the magic eraser which lets users remove unwanted distractions from the backgroundof a photo.What’s unique about it is that it can also automatically detect objects in a picturethat you may want to remove.This feature isn't something totally new but with Google’s Tensor chip and AI prowess,you can count on it to work even better here.face deblur Google is attempting to fix a common photographyproblem with the Pixel 6, blurry faces when people are in motion.To do it, you just tap on a shot in your gallery that isn’t quite sharp and if there’sa “face deblur” option: boom.Motion mode Motion mode is all about making movement comethrough in your snapshots.With this feature, the Pixel 6 will identify the subject, figure out what's moving, andadd a blur effect for that speedy look.There are two versions of Motion Mode, The first is “Action Pan.”It puts focus on a moving object and adds “creative blur” to the background of theshot.The other option is “Long Exposure” which can create light trails at night or otherneat effects all without the need for a tripod.Realtone Traditionally, it has been extremely hardto get the exposure to look good for photos where multiple faces appear in the photo — especiallyif the faces all have different skin tones.So Google worked with image experts and tuned the white balance, exposure and algorithmson the Pixel 6.So that the photos work for everyone, of every skin tone and in particular people with darkerskin tones.Live Translation Pixel 6 can translate the text as you typeinstantly in other languages.The phone can also translate messages someone sends to you.It can detect when text in a chat app, such as WhatsApp or Snapchat, is in a differentlanguage to your own one and it offers a translation.And the best thing about this is that it happens offline which means you don't need an internetconnection for this.Also, the Pixel 6 can act as an Interpreter in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese,or Spanish, fully offline.Here's a short demo.Plus it can also translate youtube videos, podcasts, and more in captions.OS upgrades Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will have the longest softwaresupport in the Android ecosystem even more than Samsung's flagships.Google says they will provide 5 years of security updates but unlike the rumors, the phone willreceive 3 Operating system upgrades.The industry leader Samsung also offers 3 OS upgrades so Google is still in line withthem but it would have been great if it was 4 like the rumors suggested.Fast charging Charging the Pixel 6 is going to be a breeze.Google will offer 30W fast wired charging, and 23W wireless charging with the new Pixelstand that has fans for active cooling.You can do 0 to 50% in just 30 minutes with wired charging.Tensor The biggest upgrade of the Pixel 6 and 6 Prois hands down Google's own Tensor chip.All the AI software features that I've mentioned so far are possible because of this chip.It's 80% faster than Pixel 5 in CPU and a massive 370% faster in GPU because Googleis using a 20 core GPU here which is even more than the Galaxy S21 Ultra's 14 core GPU.We don't have benchmark numbers to see how this compares to Qualcomm's best but likeGoogle said benchmarks aren't an indication of the real-life tests.Tensor appears to offer everything we'd want in a new mobile chip: Fast speeds, and plentyof forward-thinking AI features.120Hz The Pixel 6 Pro has a 6.7"" QHD+ curved AMOLEDwith a 120Hz refresh rate.This is an adaptive refresh rate which means it can switch anywhere between 10Hz to 120Hzdepending on the content being displayed to preserve battery life.Camera The Pixel 6 Pro is also seeing a huge upgradein camera.It can capture 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5 thanks to a large 50MP sensor.There's a 12MP ultrawide camera and a third telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom that cando 20x super res zoom.Google has also improved the video capabilities of the handset.Here's a sample they shared and the HDR here looks better than ever.All in all, at just $899 the Pixel 6 Pro marks a real entry of Google in the smartphone market,and Samsung and Apple should watch out because it looks like Google is all set to steal someof their market shares.Let me know your thoughts and I'll see you tomorrow...Peace out"
rOrGx6LK9Lo,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"This is the Google Pixel 6.It's the more affordable version  of Google's flagship phone this year.It's incredibly powerful,  the price is really good as well.Everything about it, Google has really gone  all in with the Pixel 6 I have been quite happy  with the battery.It's lasted well throughout the day. I'm really diggin' that Tensor chipset.Performance is greatthis phone runs so smooth. Titan M2 does bring security and privacylike the ability to give control over  turning the microphone and cameras off.That is amazing. Let's talk about the camera.If you want great photos, you go Pixel.The cameras on this smartphone  are absolutely spectacular.Pictures coming from this phone are all delightfully detailed,  have good amounts of contrast.And let's not forget the Magic Eraser. This feature is a smart touch up feature that allows you to erase objects  and people from your photos.It's literally like magic.Shout out to Google.  They did it big this year. There's a lot to like  about this smartphone.I don't know what Google's  doing over there, but whatever they're doing,  they're doing it right."
ZHyHEp6coSw,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,has been brought to my attention withregards to my aunt drawing that ants infact have six legs and not four for thisI apologize A Bug's Life lied to me andI should go outside more often now thatI've remedied this situation and ourAunt has six legs the entomologistshould be satisfied and we can commencewith the pixel 6 Pro teardown let's getstarted[Music]thank youyou might think that we would start onthe back of the pixel 6 Pro like otherAndroid phones but that's not the casethis time around Google has once againdesigned the pixel 6 so that the screencomes off first the phone is ip68 withplenty of adhesive around the edge andwith the tiny bezels I'm taking extremecare to not poke the side of the AMOLEDdisplay under the glass because one pokewould destroy the whole thingonce the adhesive is sliced away ontoone side I can use my suction cup topull away the glassand the whole phone opens up like a bookunder the one T4 screw is a singleribbon connecting the display to thebody I can pop that off just like alittle Legoand the screen is free from the body thepixel 6 Pro display is definitely theeasiest screen repair of 2021.with the right tools and pre-laidadhesive I better repair Tech andreplace a broken screen in about 60seconds nice work Google thumbs up forthat now you might be like hey Jerry butwhat about that fingerprint scanner andyou're correct there is one attached tothe screen but luckily this is an applewe're talking about and Google hasprovided a fingerprint calibration toolthat can be used online if your screenever does get replaced once again nicework Googlethe screen is still functioning I thinkwe should go deeperthere is a copious amount of black tapecovering the battery and circuit boardI'm curious if this is here to helpdissipate the heat at the front of thescreenwe have two more T4 screws down at thebottom holding down the cutest littlebracket over the charging port this hasa white water damage indicator on it soeven though the phone is water resistantthis little sticker will turn pink totattle on you if liquid ever does seepinsidewe have seven more T4 screws holdingdown the massive metal mid plate thisguy is pretty hefty and made with solidmetal I imagine these mid plates arewhat make the phone so heavy and keep itstructurally solid it also acts as aheat sink for the processorthere's another little guy up top andfinally with those metal plates gone wecan unplug the batterythe battery has a strange plastic pulltab on it the adhesive underneath thebattery is still far too strong for itto be removed with just a simple pull somaybe this pull strip is supposed tohelp slice through the adhesiveor maybe it's only meant to be lifted upon after the isopropyl alcohol soaks theadhesive underneathbecause the ribbon itself isn't verystrongI'll drip some isopropyl alcoholunderneath the battery to dissolve thatadhesive while we take a look at thisabsolute unit of a camera unitapparently the massive camera bump isn'tjust for Aesthetics since the camerasreally do take up all that space insideof the phone we have the 50 megapixelmain camera over here on the left withois then we have the 12 megapixel Ultrawide camera which does not have ois thenon the right side we have the 48megapixel four times telescopingtelephoto camera which also has theinternal Optical stabilization I tookone of these apart in my Galaxy s20Ultra video if you want to see how thatworks I'll leave a link for that down inthe descriptionnow that the alcohols dissolve theadhesive we can lift away the pixel 6Pro battery it is a 5003 milliamp hourcapacity I'll remove four more screws uphere at the top and again up here we getanother strange metal chunk this wouldnormally probably act as a heat sink forthe 5G antenna the 5G antenna isprobably why the entire top of the phoneis made from plastic except that withprevious 5G phones that I've opened upmy 5G antenna has always been attachedto ribbon cables and this one is justfree floating I did a bit more researchand it turns out that my phone is aninternational variant which does nothave the millimeter wave 5G so thislittle guy is just an imposter that'sshaped like a 5G antenna and taking upspace this is normal though the phonecan still be called 5G without themillimeter wave antennas not everywherehas those frequencies the earpiece andmicrophone both have red rubber ringsaround the opening to help keep waterout along with these little foam ballsI'll unscrew four more T4 screws andremove the SIM card trayand then we get our first look at thepixel 6 Pro's motherboardwhich does have the front facing 11.1megapixel selfie camera still attachedit's got the Lego style connector and ofcourse the USBC Port down here at thebottom which is soldered in place itdoes have a cool blue rubber ring aroundthe opening though the last thing wehave inside of the pixel 6 Pro is thewireless charger also hidden under a tonof graphite tape but it's definitelyback here I imagine that the rear glassReplacements of the pixel 6 Pro aregoing to be rather difficult but atleast the screen is quick and easy nowwe just got to see if everything stillworks when I put it all back togetheroverall I'm pretty impressed with thepixel 6 Pro we learned quite a lot thecameras are obviously a huge focus ofthe phone since they take up so much ofthe internal real estate we also learnedthat Google has taken a few minutes tothink about repairability which isawesome we learned that ants have sixlegs I'm still not quite sure what thatbattery pull tab was for though but heymaybe that's on me I'll get the bigmetal plate situated back on themotherboard and get that single ribboncable for the screen plugged in with itsmetal bracket and screwonce it's turned on our pixel 6 Pro isas good as new of course though if youwant to see the insides of your ownphone from the outsides I do make it awhole lot easier with my tear down skinfrom dbrand I think the camera Hardwarelooks even more impressive when you cansee how much space under the lensthey're actually utilizing grab a teardown skin for your own device with thelink in

PylWmsoOZR8,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,iphone 14 pro review take onewelcome to my review on the google pixel6 pro and the iphone 14pro i had the iphone for seven years iused the iphone from 2010 to 2017 2017 iswitched to the google pixel the firstyear the pixel came out i used it so ihave experience with the iphone and thepixel seven years each this video i'mgonna be recording right now is the isthe iphone 14 pro the second half willbe recorded with the google 6 pro nowthe reason why i went to the pixel isbecause of google phi google phi issomething that is pretty awesome butthey kicked me off in april so i can'tuse google fight internationally so whatbetter reason i went back to the iphonewhich is available with google phianyways so i'm going to talk about myexperience using the two phones andwe're gonna have a winner at the end thepixel it started off strong it startedoff strong it had a bunch of a fan fair2017 great phone great phone it startedoff strong and then the first years ofimprovement it kept improving i wasstoked because it was also kind ofunique in the cool thing it had a goodcamera and then 2019 we're at 20 lessimprovement less improvement andespecially the customer support soimagine this back in 2017 2018 imaginegoing on your phone having a problemgoing on your phone talking with thecustomer support specialist on the phoneand getting your problem solved rightthen and there it was actuallyincredible and then that went away theyoutsourced their service and it was justa waste of time all of these littleannoying things made me come back to theiphone which i just picked up todaythank youso we're going to compare i'm going totalk about my experience of the googlepixel then i'm going to go into theiphone tell you a little bit of pros andcons let me know if to like i said todayi purchased it let me know if you wantme to come back in a week and talk aboutmore about my experience after comingback to the iphone for a week or two nowlook i just want to be honest i'm not aphone guy i'm not a tech guy i'm notgoing to talk about the technicalspecifications the processor this andthat i'm about is it usable is it fun touse are they improving the usability i'mnot about the you know there's only somany years they can improve the camerabuying 69 okay andwhen things don't work can i figure itout or do i have to take a master classin order to figure it out so the pixel 6it has a lot of these like really smallissues that add up to something that'skind of not enjoyable to use firstproblem they don't have facialrecognition they took that away a fewyears ago really annoying all right butthey have fingertip recognition but itdoesn't really work so so well 60 of thetime i'm doing it twice and then it'sswiping up and saying we don't recognizeenter your phone annoying it's the onlycell phone i don't know if you can seethis but it's the only cell phone that icracked i don't wear a case i don't havea case and i just don't drop my phonebut the camera notch here is so big andunruly that i swear i would put it downon the edge and it would it would justfind the edge and crawl to it and fallover i swear i put it on the edge i lookback and i heara few times until it finally cracksthat's a bummer in the past if i wantedto turn off notifications which i doproductivity hack turn off all phonenotifications i've done this for years ihighly recommend it in the past if iwanted to do that one click google pixelnow if i want to do that it's like threeclicks and it doesn't even work so wellall the time i'm constantly seeingnotifications and in order to turn offthe individual application notificationsit used to be one click now it's twoclicks the connection between the googleplay store and the apps it's not strongfor example blinkist i just umre-downloaded the other day and tried toconnect my existing subscription in thegoogle play store to the application andit didn't recognize it so what did ihave to do well i had to take a masterclass to figure that out 30 minutes forall my language learners out there ifyou're changing your phone language itdoesn't work so well i'm i speak englishspanish and portuguese i switch betweenthe two quite often and sometimes itjust doesn't work or sometimes some appssome apps are changing or some appsaren't i'm not sure what's going onthere but it's a little bit annoyingsome other annoying things but i want tojust tap the screen toto get the time it doesn't work i'mtapping it it's not workingthat's annoying also on the googlephones the androids you can actuallyswipe down to see or swipe up to see allof the apps and the top five apps arerecommended apps but if you don't wantto have certain apps recommended thatyou use often you can say so but itdoesn't work they're still up there atthe top left corner where the first oneyou would you would know so anotherannoying thing now the coolest thingabout the pixel is that it is uniqueand expensive looking it looks nice sowhen i travel oftentimes people would bepeople would see this and they'd saylike oh it looks nice but i've neverseen it before what is it i'd say it'sgoogle i point to this and they'd alwaysbe likewhoa that's cool and sothat made me feel cool and i appreciatedthat one cool thing though i will sayabout the google pixel that i justfigured out today with my friends whohad the iphone is the google pixel hasbuilt in the google lensmy friend wanted to know uh what thisflower was and we didn't know and i tooka picture of it and it said what theflower was now luckily for iphone usersyou just go to the store and downloadthe google lens i'm not sure about thefunctionality between the two but i'msure they're similar now we arerecording with the google six pro hereis the iphone that i just purchased nowlook the pixel had potential like i saidhad potential but we all know the iphoneis just a better phone the apple systemis better um even using the pixel forthe past few years i just had to behonest and people ask me is it goodphones like it's a good phone buthonestly your apple iphone is better itis it's just better so i'm lookingforward to using the this iphone andseeing how it compared the last sevenyears i'm hoping it is a pleasure to usenow physically a pixel looks nice butthe iphone looks nicer a big thing isinstagram and everyone knows instagramworks better on the iphone the videosare better the video posts are betterthe android power users they say wellit's so customizable it's cool and letme tell you after using the android forseven years the custom the custom thecustomizability of itis not a strong suit all that means ismore things break you have to figure itout there's more apps on the iphone andwhen when apps come out they come outfirst on the iphone videos are better onthe iphone um like i said i don't knowabout the tech specs but just visuallymy friend has an iphone i've got thegoogle pixel and the iphone looks nicerespecially on instagramand especially when you want to pan thevideo like this on the google pixel itlooks a little bit wobbly it doesn'tlook like real life i noticedthat on the iphone when you pan likethis it looks really smoothso in conclusioniphone is the winneri agree based on my seven years usingiphone and pixel now before i let you gocan you help me with your favorite appsor features to reintroduce me to theiphone let me know in the commentsection i'll meet you there until nexttimeciao[Music]you
37TrAWEH6Us,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,alright guys so awesome unboxing we  have the Pixel 6 Pro now this phone  has a ton of upgrades vs the previous Pixels  including the camera going from 12MP to 50MPthis is really the first time  they've made a high-end flagshipalright so right on top we have the Pixel  and underneath that we have  an adapter Type-A to Type-C  a Type-C to Type-C cable and also your manuals  and a SIM card ejector now no power adapter this  time but the phone itself is only $900 which  is pretty much a steal by today's standards  now i was expecting this to be pretty massive  but it's actually pretty similar in size to  the 4 XL so so i'm definitely a fan of the look  and feel for it the phone comes out October 28th  and I will be coming out with some more  videos some in-depth videos before it releases
y1Yw-lENzd4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"The Google Pixel 6 almost slipped through our  teardown lineup this year, but after our deep dive  into the iPhone 13 screen repair fiasco (which  you can watch on our channel if you missed),  we decided we had to at least take a peek inside  this thing—you’ll understand why in a minute.To catch you up in case you missed the video last  week: the iPhone 13 has a small chip on the back  of the display that is paired with the FaceID  hardware, and if you replace the display without  also painstakingly moving that chip over to the  new display, you will completely lose FaceID.After the internet made a big fuss about this,  Apple quietly told The Verge they would be  fixing the issue with a future software update.That pretty much confirms this was never a matter  of security. More likely, it was one  more shot fired at independent repair,  or maybe an accidental bug they couldn’t  be bothered to fix before release.In stark contrast to Apple’s slimy  behavior, we have Google’s Pixel 6 Pro.  Thanks to Hugh Jeffrey’s teardown which  we’ll link below, we know these phones have  a similar software trigger that disables the  fingerprint sensor if the display is replaced.But! Google has done something right here.  Let’s open this up and see what’s going on.To get started I’ll put this Pixel on our heat  mat to soften the adhesive on the display.  Like iPhones, Pixel phones usually open  up on the display half of the sandwich,  which means screen repairs are usually  easy since they’re the first component off.Once I’m past all the adhesive,  the display can be fully removed by  disconnecting this single cable here.And here’s the first thing Google did right:  instead of just gluing this screen to  the rest of the phone, they actually  added a plastic frame around the edge of the  display with little clips to hold it in place.This accomplishes two things: 1, it  adds a small layer of protection to  the back of the screen to save fragile  OLED panel from your opening pick.And 2, it means if you can’t or don’t want  to replace the adhesive after a repair,  you don’t have to! Clip the screen back on and  you’re ready to go. Just watch out for water.On the back of the screen you also  can see the in-display fingerprint  reader is attached here, which is  what we’ve seen in other devices.So speaking of fingerprint sensors, let’s sidebar  for a sec. Whenever biometric authentication is  involved, it’s obviously important for  companies to consider security as they  design their devices. But the less obvious thing  that’s also important to consider is calibration.Calibration is what Apple is usually picky  about when it comes to paired device components,  and there is some actual reasoning there.Displays, cameras, any face or fingerprint  scANNERS, and many other components go  through calibration during the manufacturing  process, and swapping a part after the fact  can have an effect on the user experience,  especially if the new part isn’t up to spec.So what’s the way around this?Well, if the original component can be calibrated  at the factory, the new one can be calibrated too!  And that’s the second thing  Google has done right here.Rather than force you to pay them to repair your  phone and keep the fingerprint sensor working,  They made an incredibly easy to use  web tool that will recalibrate the  sensor in your new display, as well as I’m  guessing verify that it’s a genuine part.And they had this ready for launch! No  waiting around crossing your fingers  hoping for a software update. Great work, Google.I hope this tool sticks around longer than  some of your … other software endeavors.Alright, back to the Pixel,  I’m not going to go much deeper because we’ve  got some other exciting teardowns to get to,  but I do want to check out this weird battery  pull tab, and look at their original chips.In my way are three graphite stickers, which  might seem harmless but if you’re trying to  remove them carefully to re-use them, they  will quickly become your greatest enemy.Then some screws holding down this metal shield,  and then I can finally disconnect the battery.It seems like Google has included this clear  plastic tab hugging the battery as a way to  help remove it, but I can’t for the life  of me figure out what it’s supposed to do.We thought maybe you could wiggle it back  and forth to slice through the adhesive,  but the plastic isn’t strong enough to cut through  it without a healthy dose of isopropyl alcohol.Ultimately our strip broke and we reverted  to the good old suction cup method.That’s the third thing Google did  right, or at least tried to do right.  Lithium ion batteries age and eventually  lose their ability to hold a charge,  so it’s important to make them easy to remove  and replace. But this design needs some work—or  maybe just a friendly guide that  would tell you how to use it.Alright, let’s wrap this one  up with some tasty chip ID.You can see here I’ve got a crisp bag of Google’s  Original Chips, thanks to user Tanuki Man from our  community. I’ll just open these up and see if I  can’t figure out what a few of them are. First  one is...Oh I think that might be the new  Tensor processor! With a hint of Micron memory.I hate to be a tease but I’m going to leave the  rest of these chips for my other iFixit friends.  If you want to see more of Pixel  Silicon let us know in the comments,  and if enough people want it  we’ll post something on our site.So the Pixel 6 Pro is sort of a  mixed bag at the end of the day:  I love the protected display, and I really love  the free pairing software, but I feel that is  something that we should expect, not give extra  credit for. Battery removal procedure gets a C  for effort, but leaves a lot to be desired,  at least without included instructions.Stay tuned to our channel for  some exciting teardowns coming up:  we’ve got new AirPods and a fairly  repairable phone, if you know what I mean."
-rvLznU5TBs,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"This would be the only unboxing where we're sacred to see if it's inside it or not.Yes!Isn't that the phone?Yes!I don't know why it looks so crappy..OMG! is that how it will look?Hey, hello Irfan's video.We're going to unbox Google Pixel 6 pro.Yes! You have no idea how hard it was for me to get this phone.because Google recently launched Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 pro.But then it wasn't launched in India, Dubai and in many other countries.But they had launched it in certain countries.So it was launched in countries like US, UK and France.I have a friend in New York named Alan.. who watches ourvideo.. So thank to Alan. He sent me this phone from New York.So I'm very, very happy to unbox this.and to see this box itself right now.Google has launched flagship phones with their own chip set.So yeah.. Here we go, we got the phone.This is Pixel 6 pro.I got the black color.. because I didn't have anyother choice there was only black available there.So I paid 85k for this phone.But that's not the original price there and it's not here yetand I don't know what will be the price when it launches here.So this is the Pixel 6 pro's box.Yes guys.. It says 'Team Pixel' on the back.What Alain and I were scared of was.. Actually Alanalready told me that we aren't buying this from a store.He said we're buying this outside and some people do sellfakes ones and sometimes even the phone won't be there.But I took that risk because I had a idea ofbuying this phone and making a unboxing video.I wanted to show you guys this because many have unboxed itin english but I don't think anyone has done it in tamil.So here we go, we bought it because of that.They've given a pull tape.Looking at these it seems like a new one..I'll find out with you guys..This would be the only unboxing where we're sacred to see if it's inside it or not.Yes!Isn't that the phone?Yes!Oh yes!Damn! See how it looks..I really liked this look because they've changed their entire design.We'll set the phone aside for now.I'll show you what else is inside it.There's a USB C2C and this is the for your charging.. B to C connector.That's it.Paper works.. and the sim tools are inside it.It's really small.because it's Google.. that G-O.. they've given something related to that it seems.Oh yes.. it's black..So sexy!We'll only know if it's real or not when we switchit on because there are lots of prototype there.Even when I have it in my hands I can't believe it's the thing.Yes!This is for you guys..Oh wow! It's big.I have to use all these cameras.. the cameras behind look really good.There are 3-4 cameras on the back, I have to setup this phone now.Ah.. Look, Welcome to your pixel.English(US).. Get started.So guys I'm going to switch sim from my old phone.I've been using this one plus 8 pro for the past year and half.It's one of the best android phones that I've used.So I'm going to change it from this.. we've to take this sim out.1 sim?Guys I'll come back after the setup..Getting your phone ready.So guys I'll show you a quick difference between iPhone 13 pro and this phone.I'll first show you the wide.. iPhone can go upto 0.5 wide but this only goes till 0.7So which is 0.2 lesser than the iPhone.. The bigger number is less in this case.So I'll take photos on both phones at the same time in the same place.See the difference between the photos.As I always say.. It looks different on the viewfinder and it looks different after it's processed.So look how long it takes to process it.I think the darker places in the pixel look a little bright.But both are unique and superb in it's own way.and this is the normal one.. So let's see what's the difference in this.A photo in this..and zoomed in.. in zoom it goes upto 3 in this but this has 2.and also it has 4.Yes!and this phone has a feature for the photos.. if we take a photowith some object and if we want to remove it, we can erase it.We just have to go to the tools and magic eraser.. once we click that it analyzes the image.It analyzes what are the objects in it but I didn't analyze anything now.So let's say I don't want that AC unit in the background.. Let's see whether..AC is kind of erased.. If we want to remove something from the photo, we can use it.In this photo there are 3 dishes behind me.. I'll try to remove that.With some green added.. those 3 dishes vanished now.Nice..We could call this a great feature because most of us can use this.Even if you have some old photos and if you want to removesome object from it.. you can use this photos app to remove it.So guys.. I've used this phone for 2 days now.Not exactly 2 days.. I've used this entirely for 1 and half day.I can't give a huge review about this.. I justthought of releasing a quick unboxing and first look.So I used it for 1 day to tell you about it.First let me talk about this design.. I really like the look of this design.because it's not the usual design..because most of the phones coming out now have placed the camerasdifferently and that's how you know it's a different model.But this has a straight design and I really like that.It looks different and also when we place it down it doesn't seem odd.It's not like the phone tilts in a certain way..It seems straight.I also like that but I don't usually place by phonedown like that because the camera might get scratched.The power button and the volume buttons are on the same side, It wasa little hard to get used to after using One Plus for a long time.But yeah it's something we'll get used to in a few days.This phone's design is something I could call that's not so easy to hold.because the it could be iPhone that I'm using now or the 8 pro that I used before..it would be a little block.. not blocky exactly but it won't be hard to hold it.Anyhow.. as I'm using a case now it's very easy now.Even this would seem better with the case on. But if you're someone whouses phones without cases it won't be that comfortable in your hands.It feels slightly like it's pointy.Not only in the edge.. I'm talking about the entire phone.It's one of the crappy fingerprint sensor.It's almost equal or even a little slower than the 8 pro fingerprint sensorSo it's almost equal.. this is a slow graphics and this is a fast graphics.But still this doesn't seem so quick to me, I was excepting something more.and this also doesn't have that face recognition lock.and about the design.. As I said, I really like this bar but at the endsit collects some dust, so you may have to clean it every now and then.and let's talk about it UI.. We could say it's UI is amazing.It's stock android and it doesn't have any app oranything.. it's very clean and easy to use this android 12.Yes I think it's android 12This notification seems easy but usually wifi will have a separate icon..Mobile data will have a separate icon but they've given a single icon for that.So you have to click that and use both mobile data and wifi from the same icon.So they have a few things which makes it simple but also hard at the same time.it has a resolution of 1440x3120 pixels.. that's 512 pixels per inch.and it's a 120hz display.So it's 60 to 120hz display just like the iPhone has.It's a beautiful screen.It's a huge screen and it looks so beautiful.I want to watch youtube video or netflix movie in this screen.Compared to my iPhone and compared to my 8 pro.. obviously I can't compare it to 8 pro.and this phone has a battery of 5003 mAhThey've given a huge battery!In the 1 and half day that I used it.. I charged it twice.Once first and then again.. and I think I charged it again today morning.I didn't use it a lot anyways.. so from what I saw.. But you don't beat iPhone's battery.The iPhone 13 pro battery was fantastic, so my expectations were high.But yeah.. I think the battery will be okay in this mobile.If you ask me if the UI performance is smoother.. It's definitely smoother.It had some hiccups initially but after the update it was smooth.. very, very smooth!and it has a 12 Gb Ram.I believe it won't become slow very soon because of that.and when it comes to camera there are 3 rear cameras.. one's 50 Megapixel.One's 12 Megapixel and one's 48 Megapixel.So you can take different photos with these camerasand obviously it depends on the modes that you use.and the front camera is 11.1 Megapixel.and if I have to talk about the performance of this phone's camera...Again I compared these two phones for the past 2 days.I've compared it after taking a few photos.So my friend and I are in this photo.. we wanted to check the selfie camera.So these are the differences between them.It kind of feels like the Google pixel photos are sharper to me.and I've taken the photos of me...and my skin tone looks natural to me.and also my t shirt color doesn't look too white..So I think it got it correctly.and also I shot these photos on the rear camera.I feel like the Pixel photo represents exactly what was there.When compared to iPhone.The shots the I took on my iPhone were shot on rich contrast.We shot on two places in the night to check how it looks in dark places.First look at the car on the left.Look at the zoomed photo.I can kind of see my car number.In my Google pixel photo.and also I can see it on my iPhone.But still the lights on side look so clear in the Google but it ain't so clear in iPhone.But when I saw it in real time.. I kind of did see the car clearly.and again look at the top of the tree.. In iPhone the entire part is dark..We can't see what's there.But Google has shed some light on it and showed it beautifully.Those leaves on the tree looks so clear.Next it's the maggi.. I focused it on both phones while shooting it.I think Google captured it exactly like I saw it in real time.iPhone slightly has more contrast.. maybe that's because I've changed it.This is a photo that I took today.When it comes to this the dynamic range looks beautiful in.. both looks good.But it looks good in different ways.Bike and the auto.. this is the original color of the iPhone.That's the class.. without any filter.. I usually use a filter.I'm using a filter called the rich contrast.and tone will be in -50 and that's what I use always.So the photos you saw until now had that filter.But what I'm showing you now is normal.So look at the differences in that.. that bike isn't actually that white.I'll zoom in on that TVS bike for you..It was a random bike on the roadside..It actually looked like it is in this google photo but in this iPhone it looks whitish.Usually iPhone gives us the original color but I kindof feel like maybe google shows it even more original.I feel like even the out of focus objects seem to be in the correct color in google.Now bike's in the front and in front of my bike.. there's thatsame bike and it feels like google still keeps up with that color.iPhone has a macro camera but the google phone doesn't.So I took a photo to compare that and that's the photo that you're seeing now.I shot that leaf in close quaters.You can see the leaf but it's out of focus in this.and the phone itself said ""Go back, I can't focus on this object""and now next it's my car color.. iPhone shows exactly my original car color.But google shows how my car color looked at that place.So those are the differences.So this has a 4x zoom..4x zoom does look good.. on the surface.. the lights look better.So guys at the same time I'm doing self vlogging using the front camera.So I'm holding the pixel 6 pro and iPhone 13 pro in my hands.and also see how the audio is on both these phones.I mean listen to it.. Sorry.and also you need to observe how the dynamic range works in the back.So I look clear and at the same time observe how the lights behind me look.I think the iPhone looks better.. the clouds behind me doesn't look over exposed.and also shakiness.. Is it the same? Okay I'll know only when I watch the video.This is the front camera.. now let's use the back camera for vlogging.and also we can use the 1.4x zoom in the front camera.and also we can use the wide.Yes.. this is the difference.I've kept it at the same height...Gosh.. Now the back camera.So the selfie video that we shot upstairs.. I'm watching that video now.There's something neat in that.So while I'm watching this video it says 'Shots available' on it.and if we click on that it has placed 4-6 dots on it and if we check that dots..It has photos in it.. so you can export 4-6 photos from it.If I select export frame it will be saved as a photo I guess.Okay it's a picture now.I feel like the Google pixel has a sharper sound.and I feel it's not as sharp in this iPhone but again Google pixel has more treble.I talking about the sound that we hear.I shooting this randomly and I don't know how I look in these.But without the wider lens.. I'm just vloggingmyself in normal cam and this is how it looks.Look at the dynamic range in this.It's easier for me to hold the iPhone 13 because it's blocky.While this.. I'm not confident holding this.I shooting it on wide on both cameras.Let's say I'm vlogging and I didn't bring my camera..I don't know how useful this phone will be then.But usually if I do have to vlog I don't use the front cam.. I'll use the back camera.because obviously the rear cameras are better.So this is how it looks.When we shoot ourselves in back camera in both the cameras.So this a quick comparison.So from 1x we're zooming it to 3x now in this iPhone 13 pro.and again we're zooming google pixel 6pro to 2x.and then I'll zoom google pixel to 4xIt looks crappy.I don't know why it looks so crappy..OMG! is that how it will look?Okay..Wait a second..Oh.. it's real crappy guys.So after looking at the back camera vlog.. I'll tell youwhat's the difference.. iPhone captures it naturally.and that's what I like.and when it comes to video no other camera is able to beat it.I haven't used a lot of Samsung S21 but when I comparedthese two.. I thought iPhone was far better than the pixel.and in the motion tab there's something called the pan action.and in that there's something like if someone run it focuseson them and blurs the rest.. We could call it a gimmicky mode.They've given different modes like this in the camera.and similarly portrait mode and I didn't use that alot and in motion there's action pan, long exposure.They given a separate night sight and then video modes.It has photo sphere, panorama and all that.Another irritating thing that I observed in thisis that.. Let's say I take a photo somewhere.Let's say there's an object and I focus on it and capture it.When I capture it.. viewfinder doesn't show me what I'll see.When I want to take a photo.. in the viewfinder, if it's a dark place I see a lot of grains.But those grains are fixed once I capture that photo using the software.But when the preview of the photo looks crappy we kind of get tensed because of that.They might fix it in software updates, don't know howlong that will take.. they'll probably fix it soon.But that's not the case when it comes to iPhone, we'll see what we're about to shoot.and when it comes to front camera.. it's good. You can take selfies with wide angle.and when it comes with options like that, it's goodbecause usually the wide selfies won't be this wide.So these are those pictures and you can notice the front camera is really wide.That's a plus.So guys if you ask me if you like this phone overall.. Yes I definitely like this.I like the look and it has a huge beautiful screen and the UI is also easy to use.and talking about camera.. it's easy to shootphotos.. it's so quickly and easy to take photos.and it comes out beautifully.. I took a long exposure and it was so beautiful.In dark places it takes very beautiful photos.But does it consistently takes photos like that? It has a little problem in that area.and when it comes to video, I'll definitely go with my iPhone.Other than that this is a very beautiful phone.and this phone design reminds me of my Lumia 720because I could say Lumia 720 was my first smart phone.I love that phone.Even though it slight brings that nostalgic feel it's a new design.and.. I like it.This phone isn't available in India yet and I don't know when it will be launched here.But when it comes out.. What I said might be useful for you.and there are many google fans and many google phone fans, So they'll definitely like this phone.You enjoy this phone when it comes out.and if you guys want to see more tech video like this..I really like tech and if something new comes out I like to own it and use it.So if you want to see something like that definitely comment down below.I'll try my best to get that and make a video.If you enjoyed this video like & share it with your friends.I'll see you guys tomorrow in another video.Till then bye!See you..Tata"
nwvMLAXizuk,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,the google pixel 6 is much  better than we'd expected  and i'll be sharing the details right after this!  today we've got news that the google pixel 6 isn't  going to be the budget phone we expected and it's  actually going to pack some great performance  before we get started though please like the  video if you're a google fan and let me know in  the comments what smartphone you're using at the  moment if you haven't already then hit subscribe  now so you don't miss a thing in the future so  google officially announced plenty of information  about the pixel 6 design but they didn't give  much away in terms of specs but thankfully a lot  has since come out and is looking better than we'd  hoped google camera modder cstark27 was looking  into the android 12 beta 4 code when he discovered  an important bit of information about the google  pixel 6. the code mentions p21 which is google's  internal code for the pixel 6 and it also makes  reference to gn1 the reference to gN1 is of course  samsung's new sensor it's a 50 megapixel and it's  the first from samsung to feature both dual pixel  autofocus as well as tetra cell technology to be  fair the gN1 on its own is going to outperform the  predecessor's 12.2 megapixel and 16 megapixel  rear camera setup and it's already been used  so we know its performance megapixels aren't  everything and software plays a big part too  but google tend to be very good on the software  side of mobile photography google have generally  stuck with the sony sensors before but this  year they've moved over to samsung for not only  the cameras but also the chip powering it the  google pixel 6 is going to be sporting a 5 nm  tensor chip that will be manufactured by samsung  google ceo sundar advised that the tensor chip  builds off two decades of computing experience  and it's their biggest pixel innovation to date  now nick iasia reported that the source close to  the mata has revealed that samsung is making the  chipset and it's going to be made on the same  advanced five nanometer process as a snapdragon  8 from qualcomm it's thought that performance wise  it's going to sit somewhere between the snapdragon  8 and the new 898 but with google now in control  of the chipset and the android software we expect  some great optimizations from the combination  it's similar to how apple can create such  well-optimized devices when they've got full  control of the software and the hardware last  year's pixels focused on affordability but with  the pixel 6 they're aiming for high performance  rick ostello the exec in charge of google's  hardware has stated in an interview with the verge  that the google pixel 6 is going to be a high  quality high performance product but with that  it's also going to bring a higher price well we  don't know quite what that price is yet we expect  it's going to be starting from the 800 to 900  mark but with all these upgrades we can't complain  now unfortunately for my indian viewers we  also have a list of the markets for the pixel 6  and india is not on that list so if you were  hoping to get your hands on one and you're in  india then unfortunately you will have to import  it but overall the pixel 6 is looking incredible  we're getting surprised after surprise in terms  of specs and design although as usual we pretty  much know everything about the phone up way ahead  of launch for those excited for the pixel 6 and  the pixel 6 pro though we're now going to run  through the full specs design and the pricing  to help you guys decide if this is a phone for you  for my regular viewers you guys have seen this so  just jump to the next video but if you're new here  then hit subscribe now and we'll get right into it  with the google pixel 6 we're getting a larger  display than the predecessor and we're expecting  a 6.4 inch oled display it's going to be a full  hd plus flat display and new reports are telling  us that it's going to be a 120 hertz display we  get an 8 megapixel punch selfie camera which is  reportedly smaller than the predecessor's punch  hole and it will allow for 4k video recording  on the rear we're getting a dual camera setup  consisting of a 50 megapixel wide angle and a 12  megapixel ultrawide it will of course be powered  up by the google silicon 101 system on chip  we're expecting eight gigs of ram with 128 storage  it's all powered by a 4640 milliamp hour battery  we'd expect a bump in fast charge technology  but it will at least be 18 watts and it's also  going to support wireless charging it's likely  going to support bluetooth 5.2 wi-fi 6 5g and of  course come with the ultra wide band chip and it  will of course be running android version 12. we  can expect the google 6 to launched for around 700  well there is gonna be some hardware improvements  the in-house chipset should hopefully allow them  to keep cost down a little and google strategy is  not pricing too high next up we've got the google  pixel 6 pro while an excel model was missing from  last year's lineup it appears the xl is making a  return this year but it's now being called the pro  the pixel 6 pro is coming with a 6.71 inch amoled  display it's going to be a curved quad hd plus  display with a 120 hertz refresh rate with a  punch or selfie camera which is smaller than  the predecessors and this houses a 12 megapixel  camera on the rear we get a triple camera setup  consisting of a 50 megapixel wide angle a  48 megapixel telephoto and a 12 megapixel  ultrawide camera it will of course be powered by  the google silicon 101 system on chip it's coming  with 12 gigabytes of ram and a choice of 128 256  or 512 internal storage it's going to use a 5 000  milliamp hour battery we expect a slight bump in  fast charge technology so maybe 25 watts and again  it will support wireless charging it's likely  going to support bluetooth 5.2 wi-fi 6 5g and  come with an ultra wide band chip and it will of  course be running the latest android version 12.  we expect the google 6 pro to launch for more than  the standard version and i'm going to estimate  that the pixel 6 pro is going to start from 850 so  it's great that we finally got so much information  for both the google pixel 6 and the pixel 6 pro  it's just a shame for google that as always that  the leaks come pouring out way ahead of launch so  that's it for today's news but as always i'd like  to know your thoughts in the comments so who  out there is excited about the google pixel 6  and what do you think about the new specs but  thanks for watching the video if you liked it  smash a thumbs up if you didn't hit the thumbs  down twice and i'll see you guys in the next oneyou
HcGJQFE-xa4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,so I have held the pixel 6. hi everybodyI've also held the pixel 6 Pro I'vegotten to look at some demos and hear alot about the brand new Google designprocessor that is inside these phoneslet's talkso first things first you are probablynoticing that I'm not holding a pixel 6or 6 Pro in one of my hands and alsothat we don't have any original Vergefootage that is because Google wouldn'tlet us take photos or video the point ofthe meeting that I had with HardwareChief Rick osterlo was to get a downloadon some of the details of the new phoneand the new processor but the fulllaunch of the pixel 6 is going to comein the fall so I guess today'sannouncement is an announcement or atease or something anyway there isactually a lot to talk about includingmy first impressions of the hardware ofthe devices this new Google tensorsystem on a chip it's called tensorthat's the soc and there are a fewdetails with how it works with AI Ai andwe've got a handful of specs but the keytakeaway for most of us is simply thisGoogle is finally going for it they'remaking a flagship phone and they'retrying to take the best of the best headon in the premium space and probablywith a premium price I don't know whatthe price is going to be but I'm goingto assume over a thousand bucksafter years of mostly just makingmid-range phones Google is finallyswinging for the fences with betterscreens better cameras better buildquality the workslet's just get some of the basic phonestuff out of the way real quick theregular pixel 6 has a 6.4 inchcompletely flat screen with two camerason the back there's a wide and an ultrawide the pixel 6 pro has a 6.7 inchscreen that's a little bit curved on theedges it has glossy rails on the sideinstead of bad and it has a 4X opticalzoom folding lens like a periscope lensthere will be some memory differencesbetween the two phones but they're bothgoing to have Google's new system on achip High refresh rate screens andin-screen fingerprint sensor and otherpremium phone things like I said I heldthem and they feel like what Googlewould do if it were trying to like makea high-end Huawei phone or somethingthey're glass on the back they feelreally solid there's virtually no bezelson the front I actually like the way thecolors look in person you know likerecent pixel phones have been like nicebut kind of basic these new pixel phonesare nice but kind of nicenow as big a deal as Google finallytrying to challenge Samsung and OnePlusand Huawei at the high end might be thebigger deal is that they are using abrand new processor technically an SOCsystem on a chip that's called tensortensor is the brand that Google uses forsome of its AI Hardware so it'st-e-n-s-o-r not like it's more tense sowhat Google has done is they've takenthe tensor processing units the tpusthat they use in their machine learningdata centers and they've made a mobileversion of that that goes into the pixel6. now you probably know the basics ofwhat goes into a phone's Core specsthere's the CPU the GPU the RAM and thenmaybe there are some like co-processorson the side to handle specific taskslike image processing or securitywith tensor Google is saying that it'sgoing to do a flagship level job on allof that core CPU stuff but that the TPUpart of it is also going to be essentialto the entire pipeline it's going to bepart of the main flow of how the phoneworks sort of like how Apple added theneural engine to its a series chipsGoogle doesn't want AI to just be alittle faster on the side it wants tomake it as essential as all of thoseother standard phone parts okay but whatdoes that mean well Google did show me afew Demos in one there was a photo of akid whose face was super blurry becausethe kid was moving and flailing aroundbecause that's what kids do but the TPUwas able to fix it so the kid's facewasn't blurry what Google says happenedhere is the main camera did the usualthing that Google's you know camerashave always done it took a bunch ofphotos gathered lots of image data butthat the ultra wide sensor on the pixel6 does something new it is there just toget a super fast shot to minimize blurand so with this new tensor ProcessingUnit what they can do without making youwait for it is its machine learning seesit there is a face there and that wehate blurry faces so it grab that datafrom the ultrawide combined it with theregular data that Google's alwaysgrabbed combine them and you have aSharp Photo now I have heard and youhave heard lots of camera promisesbefore so we need to see if Googlereally can take back its lead insmartphone cameras what I can say isthat the camera sensors are finally newthey're not using the same one thatthey've been using forever I don't knowofficially what the megapixel count isyet that'll be official in the fall butthere's a rumor it might be 50megapixels Google did say that it takesin 150 more light than the pixel until 5did we'll seeso it's right to remain skeptical but onthe second demo I had a hard time notgetting excited because it was video andhistorically pixel video kind of suckspixel 6 video though I think it has alegit shot of being good because it hasthat tensor Processing Unit doing stuffreally fast in the pipeline that meansthat they can run these same algorithmson video that they usually can onlyafford to run on photos so the demo thatI saw was 4K at 30 frames per second nowof course Google is going to showsomething that puts this camera in agood light but the comparison that I sawbetween the pixel 6 the pixel 5 and theiPhone 12 Pro MaxI kind of think the pixel 6 looked thebest it was a heavy HDR shot shootingright into the sun and it managed to notover lighten shadows in that situationit also didn't do that pixel thing ofover sharpening everything like thegrass actually looked real and it hadbetter white balance than the iPhone nowagain this was just one video sampleshot by Google so I am not vouching herebut it's a good sign those are thecamera demos but you know there are acouple other demos so you may know thatthe pixel can do on-device captioning itcan play any video and caption it inreal time and now on the pixel 6 that isgoing to be faster and more accurate andbecause they have their AI processorright in the pipeline they can translateaudio in real time without an internetconnection I also saw a voice typingdemo running through the TPU it seemed alittle bit more accurate you can alsotalk to you know the phone to type butalso edit with the keyboard at the sametime both kind of input methods areactive and that was kind of neat but thething about AI on phones is that it'skind of hard to turn it into a sellingpoint with the pixel 6 the challenge isgoing to be whether or not this AI stuffmakes a noticeable difference in the waythat you usually use your phone everyday will you even notice for examplethat things can be a little bit fasterbecause the CPU and the GPU have bothbeen freed up because the AI AI chip ishandling a bunch of the AI loadmaybe you will maybe you won't by theway there's also a separate littlecomputer system for handling low-levelthings like the always on screen andthat should help with battery life butGoogle is still only promising like allday battery life they're not promisingmulti-day battery life herewe can't know if we can believe Googleabout the importance of the tensor SOCuntil we've had the chance to use thephone the only thing I do know is thatthe phone looks good and it feels betterthan any pixel has in recent memory I amnot completely sold on the big camerabar on the back but I do like that itdoesn't wobble when you set the phone ona table and it does have a tiny littlemetal Ridge to protect the glass overthe lenses and like I said I really likethe colors the only bummer is that Coralorange color that you've seen in theleaks that's only going to be availableon the regular pixel 6 not on the pixel6 Pro which has slightly more boringcolorsso that's the big stuff that I couldglean from you know half hour 45 minutesof playing around with these phones andgetting some demos from Google but thereis one more thing to talk about and it'sanother sign that they're just going forit that they're actually trying to sellphones now Rick osterlo told me thatquote this product really now is theGoogle Phone unquote so they're going toinvest in marketing and Google alsowants to grab market sharefinally Heck on Google's last earningscall their CFO had to warn investorsthat Google would be spending a lot ofmoney on marketing over the holidayseasonin addition we expect sales andmarketing expenses to be more heavilyweighted to the back half of the year inpart to support product launches in theholiday season now of course I askedGoogle you know what's the CPU clockspeed you know what's the benchmarkscompared to a Snapdragon or an exynos oryou know is Samsung making it heck who'smaking the modem no comments down theline but Google is saying that it istrying to make a phone that iscompetitive with the best phones outthere with the pixel 5 and you know eventhe pixel 4 and you know earlier pixelsthey weren't saying that this was thebest of the best Ultra Premium butthat's what they're going for now but Ido like what I see so far and if Googleis right that it's competitive on theyou know core spec stuff then it doesn'tmatter if this AI stuff turns out to belife-changing or you know just kind of anice thing on the side either way itshould be a very nice phoneobviously we have to withhold judgmentuntil the thing is actually announced orlaunched what even is a phone launchanymore anyway the official launch isgonna happen this fall and that'susually in October so look I am notsaying that you should get hyped for thepixel 6. not gonna say that not yet butI do think it's very interesting thatGoogle thinks you should get hypedhey everybody thanks so much forwatching I know this is a weird onebecause we don't have all the detailsyet but that's how Google wants toannounce this phone so there you goactually it's also how Samsung hasannounced that it's launching a bunch offolding phones in just a week or two soit's a weird Trend what do you think ofthat Trend let's talk about thatdownstairs in the commentsmy phone just fell
sUkyWEXwMd0,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"(upbeat music)- Hello everyone and welcome to 1 Cool Thing from PCMag.com,where we were talking about the Pixel 6and Pixel 6 Pro phones.I'm Sascha Segan,and I have Steven Winkelmanwho reviewed the phones for PCMag.com with us.Although Steven, you've got one phoneand I've got the other, right?- Yes, I say here's the one I like better, so--- Okay, so you sent me,you sent me the Pixel 6 Pro,you still have the Pixel 6 there,but let's start with some of the basic specsand what makes these phones unique?It's a, it has a really interesting designwith this big camera bar here, right?- Yeah. So what, like,the first thing that came to mind to meas I was reading these essays by Zadie Smithand she talks about like,something that's like sort of odd,and ugly enough that a child could design it,but they didn't.And that's sort of what it feels like,is like I was talking to somebody yesterday about this,like, with the 6, you get a little bit of the benefitof the waterfall edge so the bezels look a little smaller,but on here you have really wide bezels all the way around,a whole punch.It's also a flat display and then a curved back.It's like the proportions aren't perfectand they have this big bump.That one looks a lot more graceful.I think it's still a little divisive,but that's like, to me,I know most people care about the camera,but to me, like, I feel like that one just looksmore like a flagship.- So you're saying the 6 Prowith this waterfall display around the edge,and it's the 6 that you havethat has the flatter display in a more visible bezels.- Yeah, 'cause your bezel's bend over into the waterfall.And it just like, you know, like the,even like the rails are sort of curved,it's like you have a flat and then curved railsand the curve back and this flat panel,it's like just a lot going on,but that's it.I mean, I really liked the phone, I mean--- So these being Google Pixel phones,what people really wanna know about is the camera.And of course this phone hasa gigantic camera bump on the back,like really a camera bar.What are the specs of the cameras on the two models?- So both of them have a 50 megapixels sensor,which is a quad bear sensor.So it really brings it down to 12.5 megapixels'cause you can't turn that off.And then they both also have the 12 megapixelultra wide lens.And then the Pro has the additional48 megaPixel telephoto lens.And then on the front,the 6 has an eight megaPixel selfie camera.That one, the Pro that you have has 11.1.And the field of view is a little bit wider on the Pro,but the sensor size and like the aperture.So that sort of makes it balance out.Like I didn't really see much of a differencefor the front facing cameras.And I think that, you know,all three of the cameras are good,but the telephoto little lens is definitely,it's the phone's a weak spot, I think.- So I'm looking here at the,I'm looking here at the viewfinder on the 6 Proand the view finder buttons go to 4Xis that 4X of optical zoom?- Yeah, it's 4X optical zoom.And then it goes to 20X electronic,or hybrid.And even at 10, like it does a decent job at 10.Like, it does a,like actually it does a pretty good job,but when you get to 20,like we tested it in some really like difficult atmospheres,like an archery shot.So it's like a lot of green and like brownsand then the oranges and the reds,and like, it literally looks likea nineties Photoshop filter.It's almost like I'm like just sort of a mess.And that's, I mean,that's probably an unduly hard test for that camera,but it does give you an idea of what's going on.So it like help us understand the cameras a little betterif you're just using for like social sharing,I think it's fine, but it's not going to be,it's not going to compete with a mirrorless camera or DSLR.I mean, let's not kid ourselves.- Now Pixels are known thoughfor having really good autofocusand really good night modes, at least for an Android phone.Did we find that?Did we find that here too?- So that was the interesting thing.Autofocus is good,nightmode is not as good as in past years.Like, 'cause even I questioned it like quite a bit.And I talked to our camera expert, Jim Fisher,because we were seeing lots of light flaresand the dynamic range wasn't as good.So it was pretty,that was pretty interesting.The camera,there are lots of good things about the cameraand I think Google is still working out the software.'Cause I remember with the Pixel 4a,the camera software, like the color science and stuffwas sort of not great when it came outand then it improved over a couple months.No, it was the Pixel 4and then the 4a, it was improved by then.And I have a feeling we'll do the same thing herebecause everything gets pushed a little warm.I mean, it's good, but it's not,it almost ventures or veers towardSamsung color science without being quite as saturated.- Now, that's interesting to point out Samsung because,so our previous phone of the year wasthe Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.And you did rate this one as better than the S21 Ultra,even though it sounds likeyou're kinda putting down the camera.- Oh, I think the cameras are far better than the S21 Ultra,I just don't think it's perfect.You know, like we're,when we test them, I mean,you and I test a little differently,but when we test them,you know, like we're really pushing themas far as they can go.And I think the Pixel 6 did really good.Like, you know, it had some real wins,like with clarity, depth of field,it did really well.And the other things that were not as perfect,I think partially come from using a larger sensor in generaland like the low light and telephoto, you know,like there's not really any smart phonethat does a great job of telephoto.I mean, let's be honest.I mean they do okay, but they're not spectacular,but it's much more crisp than the Samsung is by a long shot.And the white balance is really good.I think that if you compare,like we compared it, the Galaxy S21 and the iPhone,the iPhone ultimately won out,which it was sort of interesting'cause we didn't really expect that,but there was some metering,you know, like iPhones tend to like meter a little weird.So like they will take scenes a little dark.And when you clean them up though,you get a lot better texture and a lot betterdynamic range than you would getwith the Pixel or the Samsung.And that was sort of surprising to us.And I feel like that was a biggie.Like that was one of the things thatreally sort of threw us for a long shot becausewe expected the Pixel to do a lot better with low light.- Now, outside the camera,how about other features like performance and software?Now this has an,so I'm gonna point out,I'm not gonna say that this is a stock Android,Pixels haven't been stock Androidfor about three years right now,Google Skin looks like nothing elsethat I've seen on an Android phone recently.- Yeah, I think it's, I like it,but there is,if you come from an Android phone,like if you're like a Motorola user,there is a bit of a learning curve,like figuring out how to turn off the phoneis not gonna be like, you don't just push the button.You usually, I mean,the easiest way is to use this system barto turn off the phone,the notifications bar is a little different,Material You is nice.And I really like it, but it,it is definitely,for the first time it feels like Pixelfeels more like its own OSas opposed to an Android OS.It almost feels like a real competitor to like an iPhone,like its own sort of, you know,that plays well with an iPhone.I mean, that plays well with Android.So I think it's, that's the reason I really like,and it does do a lot of things on chip,which I really appreciate it on the tensor processorlike the transcription ability and translation abilityis spectacular.So if you're sending a text,like if I'm talking to someone in Germanand they get it,they can automatically,a little bubble will pop upand it'll translate it to English.And like we tested it with like some really testy stuffand that worked perfectly.So I really liked that.And I think the tensor processor works well.It doesn't beat out every benchmark,but when you start looking at things that really matter,like what Google stuff is important.If you start looking at like the benchmarksfor like neural networks and things like that,like it wins by a healthy margin.Like it's, there's a big difference.And I think that that's what they wanted to do.And if they can really build a customer base,you know, on good cameras,good hardware and a good, you know,policy for like replacements and upgrades.I think that this could be a phone thatmaybe changes the market a little bit in the US,I'm not entirely sure,but I have a feeling,it could be a bit of a game changerbecause it's just something that we need.That's a little different,'cause right now we have just Samsung and Applefor the most part.I mean, you know, we have Motorola for like low endand a couple of flagships,but I mean, that's really, I mean,we don't have much more,I mean, you know, like we have the one-offs,but not a lot of anything special.- So how much did these,how much do these two models costand what do people need to be aware ofin terms of where they buy themand like different capabilitiesin different variants of the models?- So the Pixel 6 starts at $5.99.It is sub-6 only meaning that it only gets midband 5G.And that's probably gonna be fine for most people,you know, as it is for most of the world,if you want this phone with millimeter wave,you're gonna pay at least a hundred dollars more.If you have AT&T you're gonna pay $130 more.And to me at that point, the math changes,you might as well just buy the Probecause you get a little extra Ram with that one.- And the - And the telephoto camera.- You get the extra Ram telephoto camera,the waterfall display,the front and back of that are Victus glass.This is gorilla glass six on the backVictus on the front.So there's a little bit of a durability difference.Plus like we've not been able to prove this,but I feel like the camera's sensor is better on the Pro.And like I ask a couple peopleand they said the same thing.It just seems fasterand like, it works a little betterthan it does on this phone, on the 6.So I think that's the biggie.If you buy it from Google of course it comes unlockedand they have Pixel Pass, so you can get,you know, storage and all the things that you wantand then replace it every two years.So it's basically like Apple's thing or like,you know, most carriers do where you can place it outand otherwise you can buy it through all the carriers,but like I said, Verizon and AT&Tif you're going with millimeter wave,it really makes sense to sort of think about doing the Probecause it's a faster refresh rateand there's a lot more that comes with it.- And how much does the Pro cost?- $8.99.- Okay - Yeah.And I would say that the other thing to be conscious ofis that Google is like Apple.So you're not gonna have like any bloatware,like, which is really nice.But if you buy it from the carrier,when you put in your Verizon and things like that,you're gonna see like the bloat were built into the sim.So you're going to get some of that.And the only way to really get around thatis to use a carrier like, you know, Google Fi.- Google Fi, exactly, Google--- It doesn't add anything to your system.Oh, that's the other thing I will say is thateven if you do,this phone should work on every carrier in the USand it has global band connectivity, it should work well.But if you use a cheap phone plan and MVNO and all,make sure you check with your carrierbecause some carriers will not support these phones,or it's not so much with Pixel,but we're starting to see that more and morewhere MVNO is like,oh, we don't support that phonebecause we've not had a good experience with it,blah, blah, blah.And we're getting lots of emails.So if you are using like a cheap phone plan,just like make a call or like texts your carrierto make sure that it works,because that would be a disappointment.- Okay.Okay, great.So that's the Pixel 6 on the Pixel 6 Pro.They are available from Google and from carriers right now.They are both or ratherthe Pixel 6 Pro is our editors' choice, right,for Android phones,Android flagship phones at the moment.And yeah, thank you for watching.This has been One Cool Thing from PCMag.comand check PCMag.com for a full review of both phones."
Cajlwzk_igw,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"So we're getting close to the Pixel 6 launch as we are less than a couple of weeks awayfrom the launch event.Rumors suggested that Google would keep a launch event on October 19th and Google confirmedthat it was indeed true.Google will officially unveil the phone on October 19th at 10 am pacific time.With that said, Evan Blass has revealed a plethora of new official images of Pixel 6and Pixel 6 Pro giving us another real-life look and also showing us some software featuresof the handset.First, let's take a look at these beautiful pictures of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro.For the first time ever in Google's smartphone history, this actually looks like a real Googlephone.The photos show the phone splashed with water, suggesting it’ll have an IP rating for dustand water resistance which isn't surprising.It also shows the phone with the charger which is going to be 33W.But this is not going to be included with the phone.We also have our first look at the Pixel stand which will offer 23W of wireless chargingsupport to the Pixel 6 handset.The Stand looks bulkier compared to the older model, possibly because it includes a built-infan for cooling, and these images suggest you’ll be able to switch the wireless chargerbetween “Performance mode” and “Quiet mode” depending on whether you prioritizea faster charge or silence.Now, let's move to the software features.First up, the live space is a major at a glance update for the Android 12.What this does is, Suppose you have an upcoming flight, the Pixel 6 will note it in the top-leftcorner complete with departure time.What's new is it will show a button at the right that notes your gate and seat number,as well as the boarding QR code pass.Tapping will presumably open a bigger version for quick scanning.Some third-party apps will be integrated into this as well, as one screenshot shows a “Runningactivity” from an Adidas app that notes elapsed time and distance ran.Next, the Pixel 6 will have an under-display fingerprint scanner and the screenshot confirmsthat but it also confirms that the phone will have a face unlocking system.Now, this is not going to be as secure as the FaceID on iPhones or Google's own Pixel4, Google is actually using an RGB camera for this to work which is a little more securethan what other Android OEMs are doing.Anyway, we have some updated information about the pricing of the handset.A few days ago we got the European prices which revealed the Pixel 6 will cost 649 Euroswhile the Pixel 6 Pro will be 899 Euros.Today, a German retailer has listed the Pixel 6 and the price matches with the earlier leakedone which is 649 euros.But it also shows that Google could bundle a pair of Bose 700 Headphones as a pre-orderbonus with the Pixel 6 for free.Note that pre-order bonuses differ for different markets so for the folks over in the US, Canadamay not get the same pre-order deal.Of course, do consider subscribing for all the latest updates and I'll see you tomorrow...Peaceout"
YMlTSmusEmA,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,I just touched the new Google pixelphones we've got to look at the pixel 7in the pixel 7 Pro and there's a lotthat's the same as last year a couple ofdifferences but one thing that hasn'tchanged is the price the pixel 7 ispriced at 5.99 and it's got a slightlysmaller screen it's a 6.3 inch versus a6.4 inch but it's still a 90 Hertzdisplay and there's a couple ofimprovements there's a upgraded selfiecamera so it's got the same selfiecamera as the pro and the 6 Pro and thena cool two times crop more on that in asecond but the price is the same same 90Hertz refresh rate display so the pixel7 Pro is a little bit of the same storyit's a 6.7 inch screen again 120 hertzdisplay it's going to cost 8.99 and likethe pixel 7 it looks and feels a wholelot like the generation before it itfeels solid they're both ip68 ratedbones they feel like Flagship devices sothere's a little bit of a design changethis year the camera bar on the backisn't a contrasty black anymore it'smore of a Sleek aluminum sort of finishthat like Blends in a little moreseamlessly to the rest of the device butotherwise holding it using it a littlebit it feels a lot the same so the thingwe can't see from the outside is tensorG2 which is the new tensor chip insideof both of these phones and it'spowering things like some improvementsto voice recorder some call Qualityimprovements a lot of AI sort of voiceand assistant related items but there'sa few upgrades to the camera too thattensor is responsible for we've got acinematic blur mode which is the bokehkind of depth effect in video that'savailable now we've got the new twotimes crop mode and on the pixel 7 Proit'll actually do a 10 times cop mode onthe telephoto camera that is a lot ofZoom I'm a little skeptical but gonnaReserve judgment until I've used it alittle more but that's the story it'slittle enhancements here and there therearen't any huge Hardware shifts there'snot a big design change it's a lot thesame but maybe a little betterso that's cool we don't have to wait toolong to find out just how much better orhow much the same they're up forpre-order today and they're going to goon sale next week so get ready here theycome so I'm all about the colors I'm alittle disappointed this year we've gotwe've got lemongrass we do havelemongrass but there's no there's noCoral there's no Sea Foam I don't knowit's kind of a bummer you know keep ittuned here we'll try all the colors
fKZWeUywTW4,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,"Unusable.I'm switching.Everyone keeps saying they're swapping off the pixel six probecause the bugs they've encountered have rendered it unusable.But I can't afford to just buy a new phone on a whim.And I honestly haven't encountered any of the bugs they keep sayingare ruining their experience.That's not to say I haven't experienced any bugs though.I bought the pixel six pro the day all the reviews said it was pretty great.I was upgrading from the pixel 3 XL and a big part ofit was to get the two extra cameras and a new batterythat wouldn't have me charging it twice a day.So far I've been incredibly impressed with it.Phones are great now, especially compared to just a few years ago.I've been super impressed with the camera.I've taken some absolute bangers with no effort at all.But let's get into the bugs that others on YouTubeand Reddit have been experiencing.First up, we have complaints about the fingerprint scanner.It's not that quick.That's a fair point, but I found it incredibly reliable.Even with wet hands opened up fingers after washing up,I do kind of miss the rear capacitive scanner of the pixel three,but the Under-screenscanner is more useful more often, like when the phone's down on a desk.I've saved my right thumb twice, and this probably helps a lot with the accuracy,but it's not ruining my life to have it on the screen for an extra20 milliseconds anyway.The light it uses to scanyour fingerprint is pretty bright though, since it's not an ultrasonic one.So if you're in the dark and you have a small thumbor miss the scanner, you might go blind for a second.I'll admit I don't take that many phone calls because I'm not old as ****,but the ones that I do take are always clear,and I've never had a drop out like some have reported.As for the Bluetooth connection that I use to connect to my car every day,I did actually have trouble connecting back in December,but that fixed itself shortly after and I've had no issue since.Quick Rapid Fire bugs I haven't heard that I found on Reddit.Basically, if the phone can do it, then Reddit says it stopped working for them.These include the notification shade pulling down during calls and stuffbeing pressed top to wake, not functioning, alarms not functioning.Google assistant not working.I haven't experienced any of these bugs, but that doesn't meanthat they're not real or anything, just that your mileage may vary.And as a part of several user groups on Facebook, the gimbalscameras and apps, they're full of people complaining about the product.The Internet gets very vocal when things don't live up to their standards.Like I said at the beginning, I have experienced bugs, thoughI do get the occasional system.UI has stopped message and when I click okay, the message goes awayand nothing happens or changes.But occasionally the phone will quickly reset in about 3 secondsand it's all back to normal except your apps have been closed,which is annoying, but I think it's only happenedabout once a week, which is more than I'd like it to,but I'm not about to buy an iPhone over it.The only other bug I've had might have more to dowith Facebook Messenger, since it's the only app that it's happened with.Basically, if I'm talking to someone and then lock the phone with Messengerstill up when they reply and I get a notification,if I press that notification to unlock the phoneand go back to the conversation nine times out of ten, it'll freeze the appso I'll have to swipe up and kill the app and then reopen it.But it's only on Messenger, and Messengeris actually notorious for causing problems on everyone's phone anyway.So now we know not every user experiences a thousand bugs a day that make the pixelsix pro unusable.We can pivot a little bit and start talking about my more general experienceswith the pixel six pro after four months of using it.Starting with its design, she sexy thin bezels,a big 6.7 inch curved edge screen and clicky as hell buttons.A lot of people dislike curved screens because it makes it harderto fit a screen protector, and it may make the phone more prone to cracks.I would put myself in this camp, but also the backswipe gesture feels really smooth on the curved edgeround the back, there's the camera bend, which I also think looks great.I find it more functional because it sits flat on a tableand it keeps my fingers out of the way of the lenses.Plus, with a case on it isn't a pocket lint trap like some otherphones on the market.Also, back to the curved screen, making it more prone to cracksI actually dropped my phonefrom a two meter high shelf straight onto tiles, and it's completely fine.There's a small looking thing on the case now, but that's all not bad.The Pixel six pro was the first phone to ship with Android 12,which is the biggest visual overhaul in a while.I like it.It looks nice and the bigger bubbles are very touch friendly.Some things I'm not a fan of though, are combining the Wi-Fi and mobiledata functions because it takes an extra tap and that's just outrageous.I think it's an Android 12 thing, but now if you try to turn on a smart lightwhile your phone is locked using either device controls or the Google assistant,then your phone will ask you to unlock it before it turns on the light.And that's also a pretty big inconvenience as it makes the home screenwhile on the pixel stand far less useful as a home hub or control center.Google, please change this.It'll only respond to my voice anyway.And if anyone else hasmy phone, it's not the end of the world if they turn off the lights.One of the big things that came with Android 12 was material youwhich updates the system UI and first party apps to match your wallpaper.It looks nice.I have my wallpaper set to actually update to a new one each day,so every time I wake upI get not only a new wallpaper, but a whole new phone color scheme.It's really excitingto see what theme I'll have that day and it keeps things feeling really fresh.Some real mountains morning vibesThe battery has been pretty great for me.It definitely improved after using it for a few weeks,and I think that's because of the adaptive batterysettings taking a bit to figure out how you use your phone.I usually go to bed with about 20% left after getting sixto 8 hours of screen on time.The biggest battery bonus are 4K video recording and gaming,so you'll definitely get a lot less if you do a lot of those, a few smaller things.I love the feel of the haptics while typing and interacting with the body,but the vibrations for phone calls and notificationsjust aren't strong enough for my liking.So if it's on a desk, you might actually miss some calls.But 120 Hertz Adaptive Refresh rate is also good and keeps the phonefeeling snappy.I haven't noticed it not updating to 120 hertzlike some people have reported, but maybe I'm just not as aware of it.The screen is also pretty bright and definitely visiblein broad daylight or in my contact with the glare while driving.On average, I probably use it at about 50% brightness.A massive Swiss flag to me is the voice of text.That's actually now done on device.It's incredibly quick and you can activate itwith either a touch or by asking Google to type for you.Here's a quick example of how good it iswhen Mister Bilbo Baggins of Baghdad announced that he would shortlybe celebrating his 11 first birthday with a party of special magnificence.There was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton, Bilbo's very richand very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the shire for 60 years.Ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return, the richeshe had brought back from his travels had now been a local legend,and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say,that the back end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure.Now to possibly the best thing on the six p the cameras,almost every photo I take impresses me, and some have absolutely shocked me.One caveat is that Google's processing can be a little crunchyat times with the new senses especially the telephoto lens.But I'm hoping they'll work this out over time.But overall, I get some absolute bangers out of this thing.The camera app is simple and still gives mecontrol over the highlights, shadows and white balance if I want it,but it's already correct.99% of the time,coming from the pixel three,I was hoping that the processing would be a bit quicker on the six probut you can definitely still catch it processingif you snap a photo and then immediately check on it.You can kind of see it pop in.Another processing delay affects the wide angle camera while shooting,where it doesn't seem to be able to keep up with the HDR processingand noise reduction.So you get a lot of noise around the edges of the preview when you move the camera.But this all gets fixed once you take the photoand it finishes processing.The only other issuethat is actually kind of annoying is the lag between zooming in and swappingfrom a digital zoom of the one X lens to actually using the force telephoto.If they can get this quicker and an update, that'd be great.Use some predictive Google algorithm magic or something.I don't know.As for the video, I think it's the best I've ever seen out of an android.And sometimes I even prefer to have the iPhone mainly in skin tones,which I think the iPhone usually over processes and moves a bit too much.I think I might do a dedicated video on the pixel six pro's cameraswhere I can go more into detail about the raw photosand the different modes with a ton more samples and comparisons.I like my pixel six pro it's a great phone and at least for me, basically bug free.I'm planning to run it for at least two or three years like I did with my pixelthree XL or any unfortunate accidents that may be in its future.But if there's anything you guys want me to look deeper into.Let me know down below.Or if you just want to tell methat your pixel six pro has been the biggest thing in the world.Also leave it down below and you guys will see me in the next one.Latest."
7nM6EaR50Tc,Google Pixel 6 Pro ,Google,so we've come a long way withsmartphones and you could definitely seethat when i reviewed every single iphonein a row that's ever been made 1 through13. but thisthis should bevery different because the question ofwhat exactly defines a google phone haschanged quite a bit over the yearsthey've been all over the place butthey've also come a long way in adifferent way[Music]so what is a google phone first of allwell today the correct answer would be apixel of course right but if you ask thesame question anywhere from around 2010to 2015 the correct answer would havebeena nexus a nexus is a google phone ormaybe any number of google play editionsbut if we're going all the way back tothe beginning which we are it startedwith thisthe g1 so the g1 was manufactured by htcand this is going to be a key thing topay attention to throughout this wholetimeline because until the year 2016google has never been the manufacturerthe hardware company that builds thegoogle phone google makes great softwareand great services but absolutely hasnever been a hardware company they'vejust been out here making android sobefore the g1 android was originallybuilt to be an alternate operatingsystem for digital camerasstill a great idea by the way uh buteventually google bought android in2005. i think andy rubin at some pointcalled it literally the best deal everbut there was briefly a prototype calledthe sooner that was never sold but wasmanufactured also by htc based on theirexcalibur and used to demonstrate andtest this new version of an open sourcemobile operating systemand then by 2008 we had the t-mobile g1i remember really wanting this phone buti was on verizon and i was 15 so icouldn't just switch for a phone thatlooked cool but it did it looked so coolit was really a different design from somany of the other phones out at thattime it had a trackball in addition tothe touchscreen which wasn't that weirdbecause blackberries had those too butthere was also the end call sleep wakebutton there was a dedicated camerabutton with a state-of-the-art 3megapixel camera on the back but alsothere were these buttons down here on achin that's bent in at the bottom whichis very different and that slidingmechanism for the keyboard which isstill super springy and very satisfyingwas always pretty unique even at a timewhere lots of phones had springs andhinges and of course on top of all ofthat it was running android version oneon 192 megabytes of ram and a 320 by 480display now being different isn't alwaysnecessarily good right this phonedefinitely got mixed reviews when itdropped you know the low contrast screenwasn't amazing there was no headphonejack so you needed an adapter for thisproprietary mini usb port to plug inheadphones but this google phone was allabout android it was all about thesoftware and that's what made itdifferent from the blackberries or palmtrios or even the original iphone thatwas out at this time that's what the g1was all about so this phone had to comeout for the rest of what we're talkingabout today to even exist but what mostpeople think of when they think of thefirst ever google phoneis this the nexus one so right off thebat this phone was a flagship i rememberit was a huge deal that it launched witha one gigahertz processor that was abarrier we were approaching at the timeit had a relatively large 3.7 inchdisplay and a higher 800 by 480resolution and beyond all the new powerin the big screen there is nowmulti-touch capability so the mostmemorable feature you might rememberabout this phone was the live wallpaperbehind all your icons and new widgets ifeel like every video on this phone hadthe live wallpaper with the movingcolors and you could just touch a bunchof different spots and they'd pop upoh and it had a trackball again soclearly google liked that as much as idid there were some other things toolikethe back popped off battery removablethis phone also launched back this earlywith google goggles which let you idthings through the camera that's a longtime to be doing that and also itlaunched with the android market whichwas an early first version of what wenow know as google play store so a lotof things happening on the nexus one buti think really this is the phone thatset the tone for me from what i expect agoogle phone to be which is a flagship avery capable flagship phone but asteriskthis phone is again builtby htc you can see the little badge atthe bottom here and so at this point htcis building plenty of other great phonesbut they've also collaborated withgoogle on this one so we get an htcbuild it's pretty dense it's made ofmetal it also has a spot for a micro sdcard slot to expand memory alongsidethat removable batterythere is some resemblance to some otherhtc phones that came out around the timeand chief among them was the htc desirebut with some google specificadjustments like the capacitive buttonlayout below the screen was just fornexus one and the trackball which alsolit up as a notification light was justfor nexus one so this one was sick weirdfact though it was discontinuedcompletely after six monthsyou know didn't really get any promofrom carriers was kind of trying to besold online only and it was just overafter half a year sothen we moved on so what did we getafter nexus onewe got nexus sand this one was made by samsung so thislaunched right around the same time astheir first ever samsung galaxy s hencethe name so those phones were builtsimilarly but again this one wascustomized a bit for the googleexperience and so now that we have asequel this is the first time we'rereally thinking about the question whatis a nexus what is a google phonesupposed to be there were also somecurious things about this phone like ithad a slightly curved four inch displaythat wrapped a little bit i guess aroundyour face or felt more natural in thehand sort of sureit was also one of the first ever phoneswith nfc which would of course be thefoundation later to android pay and it'sthe first google phone with a selfiecamera it was a vga resolution selfiecamera but it was still a selfie camerathis phone launched with androidgingerbread which was one of the firstversions it was the first version tohave a darker aestheticnot quite hollow but definitely shadesof the night mode we have today and ascreen off animation also one of thecoolest most memorable things about thisphone look like a crt tv turning offit's the little things but really atthis point nexusis the phone with the mostgooglesoftware it's the pure android phone soit doesn't have any bloatware it doesn'thave any modifications doesn't have anyskin like you might find on the samsungversion or an htc or motorola phone it'sthe googlesoftware phone so the next year in 2011we got the galaxy nexus sothere's an even more obvious collabbetween google and samsung we all knowabout galaxy s this was a nexus againmade by samsung so it's the galaxy nexusand as a verizon customer this was thefirst nexus i was able to get and it wasalso the first and only phone i've everlined up outside of a store and waitedfor then i proceeded to make eightvideos on it but again this was a reallyinteresting phone as a google phone soit had a much larger 4.65 inch stillcurved 720p hd oled display and it had abetter 5 megapixel rear camera on theback with instant shutter it still had aheadphone jack and it still had aneasily removable battery remember thosedays when you could just pop out thebattery and drop in another one twoseconds later and be at 100 but now as anexus this phone launches with stockandroid 4.0 ice cream sandwich the holoos the physical buttons are gone longbefore the iphone dropped their homebutton and android is now entirely doingon-screen navigation and like imentioned this phone is in stores so igot it out of verizon store now it stillwasn't a huge seller nexuses were stillforandroid enthusiastsbut yeah i was in the thick of it iremember i had custom romscustom kernels on this phone ioverclocked this phone i was having agood time the galaxy nexusbut things were about to change so i'mgoing to skip the beloved nexus 7 tabletand the not so beloved nexus q mediaplayer that technically came up nextthey were nexuses but they weren'tgoogle phones there was also a motorolazoom tablet that i loved back in the daythat was succeeded by a nexus 10 but thenext nexus phonewas the nexus 4. so now we've moved onto a google phone made by lg so thisphone was interesting it sort of took astep back from being a flagship on theshelf of a carrier store and went backto being a great deal that you could getonline so we have this unique flat glassdesign with no camera bump and a superunique dot pattern underneath that youcould see when the light hit it acertain way it had a slot speaker aroundthe back which is an interesting choicebut at least you could cup your handaround it and hear it better at thefront but of course now with this glassdesign it becomes the first nexus thatsupports wireless charging but the backis no longer removable this phonedropped for 299 which in 2012 yep was agood deal although that was the base 8gig model so you could spring for theupgraded 16roomy 16 gigs of memory for 349 bucksum it was lacking lte at the time whichwas a bit much but overall the phone waspretty well liked so now what's a googlephoneuh a well-specced competitive stockandroid phone for enthusiastsi guess well nexus 5 was built by lgagain this time loosely based off of thelg g2 but this was a design i reallyliked it was understated had somecontrasting black and white hardware icalled it the panda phone because whoelse did a white earpiece like thisnobody but honestly the rest of thephone was pretty forgettable they got upto a flagship spec again snapdragon 800with two gigs of ram 1080p display but iwas pretty unimpressed by the camera itdid make hangouts the default textmessaging app but if you know anythingabout google messaging appsyeah that wouldn't last long i thinkprobably the most significant thing thatcame from the nexus 5 was a little extrafocus on the stock google now launcherso these phones have always shipped withaosp which is android open sourceproject it's basically just a version ofandroid that you get when you downloadit straight from google stock blanknothing extra added but now google'sactually starting to add a little bit ofits own special sauce on top of androidwhen it ships it with a nexus phone sothis shipped with android 4.4 kitkat oneof the two candy themed collabs but thelauncher had google now built in whereyou could swipe over from the homescreen and it would give you these cardsand the google assistant would show youthis information on the cards that itpredicted would be useful to you beforeyou would even ask for it so stuff likethe weather at a destination you'reabout to fly to or the traffic on yourway to work before you leave in themorning really smart stuff so nexus 5was an uninspiring piece of hardwarepretty simple and basicdefinitely was the beginning of seeingsome of google leaning into being asmarter phone than your typicalsmartphonealso shout out to the red version ofthis guy that came out a few monthsafter launch that was so bright that itliterally over saturated pretty mucheveryone's camera i remember it wasimpossible to make this phone look theactual red that it shipped on videobut it completed the trifecta of themkbhd edition smartphone colors so thatwas very niceokay here comes 2014and here comesshamu the most unnecessarily massivenexus of all timenowmade by motorolaso okay at this point is there any themeto who makes the nexus phone each year imean it feels like they just offer up atwo-year contract every time and see whowants to sign allegedly they were reallyclose to working with huawei on thisyear's phone but had to scrap it at thelast second so okay we got nexus 6 justbased loosely around the 2nd gen moto xbut just way bigger and it is huge it'sgot a massive nearly 6 inch 1440pdisplay flanked by stereo front-facingspeakers and the bezels and you know wehave big screens nowadays but this wasalso in the days of the 16x9 aspectratio so it's super wide too just hugein the hand not to jump ahead too muchbut nexus 6 is actually bigger and widerthan the pixel 6. so huge display huge3200 milliamp hour battery withmotorola's turbo charging huge new 13megapixel camera with a huge new ringflash around it and huge new flagshipspecs snapdragon 805 three gigs of ramand up to 64 gigs of storage and android5.0 lollipop but along with all theseinsane specswas an insane price for the time sonexus 6 cost 649for the base 32 gig version and awhopping 700 bucks for the 64. so it wasnot only big but it had the biggestprice tag of any google phone yetespecially coming off the back of themore competitive nexus 4 and 5. fun factthe internal code name of this phonewhen they were developing it shamuthe orca the whalesee everyone knew it was big but maybethe most sneaky important feature of thenexus 6came in the camera so this was the firstever google phone to launch with hdrplusdidn't seem like a huge deal at the timeit was just maybe one more feature inthe camera but it was combining multipleframes all together in a quick shot tobring in more dynamic range andnotoriously took a lot of processingpower so hdr plus was just an optionthat you had to turn on to get thatextra latitude but that right therethat was an inflection point forsmartphone cameras in general i meannowadays if you don't have hdr you'renot really doing it right but just thefact that we take for granted now onesingle shutter pressinformation from several differentframes all get processed and smartlyblended togetherbig moment there so then nexus 9 youwere greatnexus playerdefinitely not great but then in 2015 wegot two new nexus phones at once we gotthe 5x made by lgand the nexus 6pmade by huaweiokay so the nexus 5x as the namesuggests was a bit of an upgrade fromthe nexus 5. it added a fingerprintreader on the back updated specs biggerbattery switched to usb type c all theclassics it did also have boot loopissues that thankfully never affectedmine but that phone was 379then at the same time we get this allmetal jacket nexus 6p p for premiumprobably but this was an all metal buildwith a camera visor at the top it hadthe flat sides which we still know todayas premium the ridged power button thefront-facing speakers and the highestend chip and hdr got even better thisone had a stellar camera 6p was prettyuniversally praised as literally one ofthe best if not the best android phoneson the planet this one sold for 4.99 sogoogle you just madetwo differentnexuses at the same time nexusesnexi you made two of them at once rightone of them cheaper one of them moreexpensive one of them budget one of themcontender for phone of the year verypremiumand so this is usually what you see fromcompanies that are trying to offertwo different options for two differentcustomers it's what you get while you'retrying to appeal to a broader variety ofthe masses which is an interesting moveand then that's the last we ever saw ofnexus so enter google pixeli just want to say as a video enthusiasti love the word pixel as a name for aphone but that is a new name so we'vehad nexus and nexus up until this pointwe could think of as the google softwarephone right we had all the samsungs andhtc's and motorolas and huawei's of theworld making all their own phones butthe google version with the nexus namewould be stock android quick updatesstraight from googlethere was also a brief stint of googleplay edition phones in 2013 to 2014 thatcombined the hardware of the best phonesin the worldwith google's stock software does anyoneelse remember these i love these phonesthere was a google play edition samsunggalaxy s4it was amazing there was a sony xperia zultra there was a google play editionhtc one m8 honestly some of the bestphones everbut this is a brand new thing this ispixel it's not nexus so why the rebrandwhy the new name well there's a bunch ofdifferent correct answers i think tothis but basically this is the firstphone that's designed and builtby google so there's your google logodown there it's the first iteration ofthis new two-tone design i meaninternally they still had some help butthis would be considered the first realgoogle phonebut also a big part of what makes pixelnext level is how they really startedleaning into it being a particularlysmart smartphone so it already had thatgoogle launcher and the clean look butwe're drifting further away from aospthis is not the exact version of androidyou'd get straight from google this isnow like the google skin on top ofandroid so it's the first android phonewith the google assistant built in andit's got the camera again taking prettybig leaps forward thanks to hdr pluscontinuing to get better and i justremember seeing this announcement andgetting really optimistic about thefuture of competition becausesurely if we have the iphones of theworld where apple controls the hardwarethe software the chip the wholeeverything was made by apple to workperfectly togetherthen surely this is the beginning ofgoogle doing their best version of thesame thing you know so google pixel 2i thinkwas peak pixel and that's at least intwo ways right with that cameraand with that two-tone design i love agood panda phone already or stormtrooperwhatever you want to call it we sawhints of this with the nexus 6p butgoogle is now just full-on embracing thetwo different finishes on the back bycontrasting them with black and whiteand then the colored power button wowwhat a great idea for just a littlesplash of color a little accent on theside but there were a few other notablethings here they got rid of theheadphone jack they did have some blueshift display controversy on the xlversion which used the new lg p led andi even made a video a few months afterlaunch about why i don't use the pixelanymore because of slowing down issueswith the software over time but what thepixel 2 was really famous forwas this single camera so it had a new12.2 megapixel sensor in there andfeatured the latest and greatest fromgoogle's camera app their hdr plus andtheir multi-fame processingand this phone just kicked outincredible photos it leapfrogged overeverything else out it had excellentdetail sharpness dynamic range shutterspeed focus everything and the videos ittook weren't even that good but thephotos were just sogood that thiswas basically universally praised whenit came out as the best smartphonecamera of all time but also at thispoint i think it's worth talking aboutsales so this one comes out google'sselling three to five million pixels peryear which is nice right but at the sametime you know apple selling 200 millionphones a year samsung selling 300million phones a year so even with thisincredible world-class camera greatreviews enthusiasts loving it greatsoftwareit's not a lot of people buying it sopixel 3 comes out in 2018 and every bitof it feels just like a refinement onthe pixel 2 which is great for peoplewho love the pixel 2 but the minorimprovement alone probably isn't goingto spike sales as you can imagine andthere's also regular and an xl versionof every pixel since the first one butthis one's xl came with a super duperalpha omega bathtub notch up at the topat this point i think we can say it'sthe deepest notch we've ever seen in aphone it did have both a regular andultra wide selfie camera up at the fronton either side of the earpiecefront-facing speaker sohonestly i loved that extra ultra wideselfie camera on the xlbut nobody really loved the notchthere was an old google tweet basicallytrying to justify it by saying oh don'tworry the notch to display ratio isactually less than many of our topcompetitors it's like yeah that'sprobably true but also so would thisnotch but that doesn't make it goodeither way aside from that minor tweaksoverall refinement of the buildmaterials ip68 water resistance finallyup from ip67 wireless charging getsadded herenight sight is added to the camera appbut basically the same revolutionarycamera as last year and overall prettysolid update doesn't really move theneedle you know it did move the needlethoughthe pixel 3 athis phoneshifted things for google so halfwaythrough 2019 at google i o theyannounced a budget version of the pixelit's a 3a and a 3a xl starting at 399which is half the price that the pixel 3started atso it has all the same software smartsall the stuff that made pixelenthusiasts love the phones but made abudget version with a lower poweredinternals polycarbonate instead of metaland glass still has great battery lifein the same world-class camera that putthe pixel on the map for so many peopleand it was a hit basically from themoment this phone was released it wasmost of the pixel salesand so there's some upside and somedownside to this level of visibility theupside obviously is there's now morepeople seeing and using these phones andgoogle assistant and all this greatstuff and the camera butnow the most successful version of thisproductis the cheap onewhich means that when people think ofwhat is a google phone what is a pixelthey think of it as the cheap phone thattakes good pictures they're not thinkingof the fast one or the high-end oneit's the cheap phone with the goodpictures pixel 4 came out after that andhonestly felt like a slight misstep itlaunched again starting at 800 bucksthey're trying the flagship thing againbut there were a bunch of quirky weirdfeatures that either didn't really makesense or didn't pan out the way googlewas probably hoping now again it had thesame a plus camera as the pixel 2but it's been two years now so the restof the world is starting to catch up andit's not so unanimous anymore and it wasa bit short on battery life and with theaddition of a second rear camera for thefirst time they chose a telephotoinstead of a much more popular anduseful ultra wide even though theytalked a lot about the software superres zoom and not needing a telephotoanyway it was the solely radar array upfront that was an interesting idea witha ton of cool demos and other productsbut really turned out to draw a lot ofpower and ultimately not have thefunctionality in a phone that peoplewere looking for and it would get mixedin a year so pixel 4 stepped back frombeing one of the best phones out periodto beinggenuinely pretty hard to recommend imean not a lot of people bought thisphone the sales figures say there wasabout 2 million sales of pixel 4 in thefirst six monthsinterestingly my review of the pixel 4got4.8 million views in the first sixmonths soa lot of attentionjust not a lot of people buying thephoneand that's until pixel 4a came out sonaturally google followed up thesuccessful pixel 3a budget king with apixel 4a and they followed the sameformula with a lot of the same stuffthat people liked about the 3a samecamera again polycarbonate two-tonedesign but this year the materials wereeven better a little more texturedpolycarbonate the screen was fantasticespecially for the pricethey crushed it plus they even loweredthe price to start at 349 so to no one'ssurprise following the same formulagot them a lot of people to really lovepixel 4a so okay at this point it feelslike google sort of settled intosomething with the pixel right got pixel3 pixel 3a pixel 4 pixel 4adisappointing flagshipsmash hit budget phone disappointingflagship smash hit budget phoneand so if you keep going down this pathyou continue to cement pixel as a budgetphonemaybe the rest of it kind of fades intoobscurity and it even kind of felt likethe design was slowly getting moregeneric and plainthe two-tone is kind of goneeven the colored power button is a bitmore muted it's succumbed to thepressures of the industry the backfingerprint reader is gone the headphonejack is gone so this google phone thisthis pixel has basically just become uhnot that impressivehardware wise but really incredible likesilo for google to demonstrate all oftheir machine learning and theirsoftware and aiand that's not something that's going tosell a whole ton i mean enthusiasts willlove itbut it doesn't even let them reach theirmax potential with that either they're alittle limited by whatever the latestoff-the-shelf qualcomm chip is capableof or designed forso thisspoiler alert is right around when theystarted making some serious progress onsomething new in the background so thisis why pixel 5 and 5a felt kind of likeplaceholder phones pixel 5 here is a 700flagship so relatively normal price butthere's no xl version just one sizethere's no higher capacity storageversions just a single 128 gignon-expandable specsnapdragon 765 g just an off-the-shelfupper mid-range chipthat's it it's justit's here it's a phone it's like theit's like the blank canvas2020 of phones like oh you've got acorner cut out for the selfie camera sodoes everybody else it's got wirelesscharging it's got no headphone jack it'slike we've seen this shell beforewell maybe not with thesoft touch on top of metal but insideis where all that software magic isstill happening that all the enthusiastswho love the pixel still care deeplyabout all that's still in there sothat's how most reviews including my ownlooked at the pixel 5. decent ifunderwhelming hardware but android 11 isbetter than ever google assistant isimproving on these incredibly usefulpixel exclusive features on top of aosplike assistant screening spam calls andit's once again basically the samecamera stack as the pixel 2 butcomputational photography still bringsout the best of this hardware and it isstill one of the best photo takers inthe industry then pixel 5a drops almosta year later again with one spec and onesize and it isvery very very very very similar to thepixel 4a 5g from the year before butpredictably people like a big screen anda big battery and a big camera performerfor a low price so this was again thewinner but this whole time kind of inthe backgroundsome of it because there's always rumorsof things in the tech industry but someof it because it was truly new wasrumors of google working on a phone thatis even more of a google phone thanbefore and google's pretty bad atcontaining leaks so a lot of that stuffgot out and they just straight upconfirmed it and so after many teasersand pre-released information and leaksit finally arrived 2021's pixel 6.this is now the apex of being the mostgoogle phone everfinally i actually remember being insome meetings and briefings with somegoogle employees before this phone cameout they're showing it to me and theyall kind of have this smirk on theirface like yeah we finally did it wereally made a google phone this timebecause now this one has a google designgoogle software and a google designedchip called tensorand so kind of like how the name changedfrom nexus to pixel when they finallystarted doing the design themselvesthey've definitely changed up the designhere with this camera bar at thisbeginning of them designing their ownsilicon and the benefits of the newsilicon with the dedicated machinelearning accelerators has been very realboth with the photo and video processingnow and speech to text things like thatthe rest of the phone is also now prettyhigh end across the board mostly notquite bleeding edge but you add thelarger higher resolution high refreshrate displays faster charging more ramand a suite of all new much largercamera sensors featuring a massive mainsensor so then it does start to feellike a pretty big upgrade the mostimpressive thing about this phone thoughmight just be how much effort google nowis putting in to making sure the worldknows that this is a flagship i mean allthe advertising spend all the effortgetting this in front of people's eyesthis is a flagship and it's a googleflagship and it's a good one that's whatthey want us all to thinknowfrom some conversations i've had withpeople at googlethey were working on tensor for a longtime and they actually wanted to havethis out earlier they're actuallyplanningon pixel 5 being the first phonewith tensorbut then with covid and supply chainissues and a bunch of things getting inthe way at the last second they kind ofhad to bail on that but they stillwanted to drop a new phone so they justput a snapdragon 765 g in itshipped it called it a dayand kept putting their heads down forpixel 6. so it is out now and whilethey're definitely trying to be flagshipflagship flagshipthey're also definitely not going to shyaway from the proven formula of making apixel 6a i would totally expect to seethat sometime soon probably going tolook a lot like this but cheapermaterials it'll come out it'll probablyalso do really well but i think now ifyou revisit the question one last timeof what is a google phonewe see google trying to push an answeron us which isit's a flagship phone it's genuineoption and it's got a lot of good stuffand that's where we stand today 13 yearsof googletrying to make a smartphoneand going from the g1 to the nexus oneto the pixel oneand the merging from uh from defining agoogle phone as the phone made byanother manufacturer with the googlesoftware on it alongside another versionthat has some skinto being a google play editions to beingthe nexusdesigned by googleall the way up now to the pixel whereall the way top to bottom you prettymuch have google stuff so the tensorphoneis the beginning of the new definitionlooking forwardfor what is a google phoneand we'll continue to see that evolveover time from here either way that'spretty much it definitely let me knowwhat other lines of phones should i lookat there's a lot of other optionsthere's the galaxy s line there's theoneplus line a bunch of others leave itin the comments section below under thatlike button thanks for watching thanksfor subscribingcatch you in the next onepeace
